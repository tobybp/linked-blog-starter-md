Sonnet: 
I, Me, Mine

Within the deepest fields of my mind
I often try to find within my soul
Some willingness in order to be kind
Fulfilment to make myself feel more whole

Everybody striving for will power
Going to school working for more knowledge
While i'm just trying to build the strength to shower
Walking down the stairs to eat my porridge

Going to Africa, seeing December
Watching the elephants and the giraffes
Then going back to school in September
Ready to go down all my learning paths

Every day I keep on powering on
Through all the troubles I will remain strong
