## Displacement - Time Graph
Gradient = change in displacement / time = velocity
Area = Not a quantity
Horizontal line = Object stationary
![[Excalidraw/DisplacementTime1.md|600]]
Final displacement = -250m
Total distance walked = 150 + 150 + 250 = 550m
Walking fastest on the way home (steepest gradient).
Average speed = 550m / (9.5 x 60) = 0.9649122807 m/s = 0.965m/s
Average velocity = -250 / (9.5 x 600) = -0.4385964912m/s = -0.439m/s
## Velocity-Time Graph
Gradient = change in velocity = acceleration
Area = displacement
Horizontal Line = Constant velocity

When a local train leaves a station it accelerates at a uniform rate of 3ms$^{-2}$ to its maximum speed of 60ms$^{-1}$. It then maintains this speed for 2 minutes before slowing down uniformly to a halt at the next station. The whole journey takes 3 minutes.
a) Sketch a distance-time graph for the journey.
