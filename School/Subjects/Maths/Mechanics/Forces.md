#### A force is a vector

Weight is a force due to gravity - W = mg
Reaction force is caused by the contact between two objects, always perpendicular to the surface.
Friction is the resistance force caused by the contact of two surfaces that are rough
#### External forces
Tension is a force that prevents two objects moving apart
##### Newton's First Law
Every object continues in a state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted on by a resultant external force.
##### Newton's Second Law
Resultant force = mass x acceleration
F = ma
##### Newton's Third Law
When one object A exerts a force on another object B, then object B exeerts an equal and opposite force on object A.
## Equilibrium
- No resultant force
- No resultant moment
## Force Diagrams
- Keep them simple
- Show forces with line at action
