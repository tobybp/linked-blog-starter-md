| Light Object            | An object with a comparatively small mass; assumed to have a zero mass.                         |
| Particle                | An object with negligible dimensions; its mass is assumed to be concentrated at a single point. |
| Smooth Surface          | A surface where there is no friction between it and any object in contact with it.              |
| Wire                    | A rigid thin length of metal which is treated as one-dimensional.                               |
| Rod                     | A rigid object such as a beam which is one-dimensional; assumed mass is distributed evenly.     |
| Inextensible String     | A thin length of material that does not stretch under load.                                     |
| Rough Surface           | A surface where there is a frictional force between it and any object in contact with it.       |
| Lamina                  |                                                                                                 |
