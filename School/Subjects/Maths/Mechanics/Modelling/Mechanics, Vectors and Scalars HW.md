| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light Object            | An object with a comparatively small mass; assumed to have a zero mass.                            |
| Particle                | An object with negligible dimensions; its mass is assumed to be concentrated at a single point.    |
| Smooth Surface          | A surface where there is no friction between it and any object in contact with it.                 |
| Wire                    | A rigid thin length of metal which is treated as one-dimensional.                                  |
| Rod                     | A rigid object such as a beam which is one-dimensional; assumed mass is distributed evenly.        |
| Inextensible String     | A thin length of material that does not stretch under load.                                        |
| Rough Surface           | A surface where there is a frictional force between it and any object in contact with it.          |
| Lamina                  | An object with an area but no thickness, its mass is assumed to be distributed across the surface. |
| Smooth and Light Pulley | A massless wheel which carries a rope, where the tension in the rope is the same on either side.   |
| Uniform Body            | An object where mass is distributed evenly, assumed to be concentrated at the centre of mass.      |
| Air Resistance          | The force experienced by an object as it moves through air; assumed to be negligible.              |
| Bead                    | A particle with a hole in which moves freely along a wire or string.                               |
| Gravity                 | The uniform force of attraction between all objects which acts vertically downwards.               |
| Peg                     | A support from which a body is suspended; assumed to be dimensionless and fixed.                   |
