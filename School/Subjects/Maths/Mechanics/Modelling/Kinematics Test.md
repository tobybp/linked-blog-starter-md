12) A pebble is projected vertically upwards with a speed of 21 m/s from a point 32m above ground. Find:
a) The speed with which the pebble strikes the ground
	s = ?
	u = 21
	v = 0
	a = -9.81
	t = 
	v$^2$ = u$^2$ + 2as 
	0$^2$ = 21$^2$ + 2(-9.81)(s)
	0 = 441 - 19.62s
	s = 22.4770642202m
	Highest point = 32 + 22.48 = 54.48
	s = 54.48
	u = 0
	v = ?
	a = 9.81
	v$^2$ = u$^2$ + 2as 
	v$^2$ = 0$^2$ + 2(9.81)(54.48)
	v$^2$ = 1,068.8976
	v = âˆš1,068.8976
	v = 32.69
b) Total time for which pebble is more than 40m above ground
	s = 8
	u = 21
	v = 
	a = -9.81
	t = ?
	s = ut + 1/2 x at$^2$
	8 = 21t + -4.905t$^2$
	4.905t$^2$ - 21t - 8 = 0
	t = 4.6334
	...
	s = 22.48
	u = 21
	v = 0
	a = -9.81
	t = ?
	 = 21/2 x t
