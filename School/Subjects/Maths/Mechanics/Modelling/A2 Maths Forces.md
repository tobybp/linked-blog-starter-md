When two objects come into contact there will be a contact friction where F = μR
μ = coefficient of friction
R = reaction force
The friction reaches a maximum on the point of movement (limiting equilibrium) and maintains this value during movement.

##### A box of mass 20kg is to be pulled across a rough floor by a string inclined at 30° to the horizontal. The coefficient of friction between the box and the floor is 0.6. Find the tension in the string when the box is on the point of moving.
