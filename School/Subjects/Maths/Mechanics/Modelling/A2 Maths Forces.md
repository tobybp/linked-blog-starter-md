When two objects come into contact there will be a contact friction where F = μR
μ = coefficient of friction
R = reaction force
The friction reaches a maximum on the point of movement (limiting equilibrium) and maintains this value during movement.

##### A box of mass 20kg is to be pulled across a rough floor by a string inclined at 30° to the horizontal. The coefficient of friction between the box and the floor is 0.6. Find the tension in the string when the box is on the point of moving.

##### A particle of mass 2kg slides down a surface that makes an angle of 25° with the horizontal. The coefficient of friction between the particle and the surface is 0.4.
a) Find the acceleration of the particle down the slope
![[particle up slope|700]]
A force PN is now applied to the particle up the slop.
b) Find the minimum value of P needed to stop the particle from sliding down the slope.
