#### Males:
IQR = 180
Outlier = 400 - 180
\< 220
= 580 + 180 
\> 680 

#### Females:
IQR = 80
outliers = 260 - 80
< 180
= 340 + 80
\> 420
170 and 440 are outliers, should be worried.

#### Example:
The masses of arctic foxes are found and the mean mass was 6.1kg. The variance was 4.2.
An outlier is an observation which lies +-2 standard deviations from the mean.
a) Which of these arctic fox masses are outliers?
2.4kg    10.1kg    3.7kg    11.5kg
