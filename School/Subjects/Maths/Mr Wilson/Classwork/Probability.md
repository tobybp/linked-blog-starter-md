- A school has 75 students in year 12. Of these students, 25 study only humanities subjects (H) and 37 study only science subjects (S). 11 students study both science and humanities subjects
	a) Draw a two-way table to show this information
	b) Find:
		i) P(S' n H')
		ii) P(S | H)
		iii) P(H | S')
a)

|     | H   | H'  | T   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S   | 11  | 37  | 48  |
| S'  | 25  | 2   | 27  |
| T   | 36  | 39  | 75  |
b) i) P(S' n H') = 2/75 = 0.02666666667
ii) P(S|H) = P(S n H) / P(H)
 = (11/75) / (36/75)
 = 11/36
 iii) (25/75) / (27/75)
 = 25/27

#### Two four sided dice are thrown together, and the sum of the numbers shown is recorded.
a)  Draw a sample-space diagram showing the possible outcomes
b) Given that at least one dice lands on a 3, find the probability that the sum on the two dice is exactly 5.
c) State one modelling assumption used in your calculations.

a)

|       | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1** | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
| **2** | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     |
| **3** | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     |
| **4** | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     |
b) $P(Î£ = 5 | 3) = 2/7$
c) fair dice

A and B are two events such that $P(A)$ = 0.55, $P(B)$ = 0.4 and $P(A m B)$ = 15.
a) Draw a Venn diagram showing the probabilities for events A and B
b) Find:
	i) $P(A | B)$
	ii) $P(B | A u B)$
	iii) $P(A' | B')$

a)
![[venndiagramquestion1]]
b)
i) $P(A n B) / P(B)$
$0.15 / 0.4$
ii) $P(B n (A u B)) / P(A u B)$
= $0.4 / 0.8$
iii) $P(A' n B') / P(B')$
= $0.2/0.6$
= $1/3$

Two events A and B are such that $P(A)$ = 0.4, $P(B)$ = 0.2 and $P(A u B)$ = 0.5
a) Calculate $P(A n B)$
b) Determine whether or not A and B are independent
c) Calculate $P(A|B')$

a) P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B)
0.5 = 0.4 + 0.2 - x
0.1 = $x$

b) independent if 
P(A n B) = P(A) x P(B)
0.1 = 0.4 x 0.2
Therefore not independent

c) $P(A | B') / P(B')$
$0.3/0.8$
