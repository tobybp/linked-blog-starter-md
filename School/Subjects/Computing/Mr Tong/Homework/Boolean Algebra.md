## Augustus De Morgan

#### Background

- A mathematician and logician (1806–1871) who formulated De Morgan's laws to simplify Boolean expressions.
- These laws gained significance with the advent of computers due to their application in logic and circuit design.

## De Morgan’s Laws

#### General Principles

- Any Boolean function can be implemented using only NAND or NOR gates.
- Using a single type of gate reduces manufacturing costs.

#### De Morgan’s First Law

#### Practical Use

- These laws are used to simplify logic expressions and convert between gate types.

## Simplifying Boolean Expressions

#### Simplification Techniques

- Apply De Morgan’s laws and other rules to minimize expressions.
- Use truth tables where XXX and YYY are either TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).

#### Key Simplification Rules

1. **Commutative Rule**

3. **Distributive Rule**

4. **Absorption Rule**
    
    - Helps simplify redundant terms.

## Logic Gates and Circuits

#### NAND Gate

- Combines AND and NOT gates.
#### NOR Gate

- Combines OR and NOT gates.
#### Simplifying Circuits

- Break down circuits into their logic components.
- Write Boolean expressions for each step and simplify the output.
- Determine the number of gates needed after simplification.
