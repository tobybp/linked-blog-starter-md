## Programming paradigms
A programming paradigm is a type of programming. Different paradigms are better than others for different problems. For example calculations, maze generation, food delivery app, or sql, may all require different programming paradigms.
### Common Paradigms:
- Procedural
	Follows a step by step recipe based approach. Programs are a sequence of instructions that change the program as they run. Variables can change over time
- Object Oriented (OOP)
	Models problems using objects. Objects contain properties and methods. Programs are made of interactions between the objects.
- Declarative
	Declarative focuses on what needs to be done and not how it can be done. Programmer specifies a result and language decides how to get it.
- Functional
	Based on maths functions. A program is made by defining and combining functions. Each function takes inputs and outputs.
## Languages and paradigms
Some languages support multiple paradigms, e.g. python
other languages focus on one, such as SQL (declarative), or Haskell (functional)
## Functions
A function takes inputs and returns an output, does not change any data outside of itself.
#### input -> function -> output
## Domain and co-domain
Domain is set of all possible values that can be inputted to a function
The co-domain is set of possible outputs.
## Types 
Functional languages like Haskell use variable types lots
- Int - whole numbers
- Float/double - real numbers
- Bool - true/false
- Char - single characters
- String - sentences / words
## Typeclasses
A typeclass is a group of types
e.g. Num typeclass contains int, float and double.
## Type Variables
Functions can work with more than one type
Haskell can get types automatically, but you can also specify a type to use.
## First class obkects
First class objects are entities that can:
- Be in expressions
- Assigned to variables
- Passed as arguments
First class objects contain:
- Integers
- Floats
- Booleans
- Characters
- Strings
- Functions
## Composition of Functions
Functions can be combined, so the output of one becomes the input of the next. This is known as function composition. Allows complex things from sim
