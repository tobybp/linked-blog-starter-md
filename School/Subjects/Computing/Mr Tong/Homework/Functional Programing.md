## Programming paradigms
A programming paradigm is a type of programming. Different paradigms are better than others for different problems. For example calculations, maze generation, food delivery app, or sql, may all require different programming paradigms.
### Common Paradigms:
- Procedural
	Follows a step by step recipe based approach. Programs are a sequence of instructions that change the program as they run. Variables can change over time
- Object Oriented (OOP)
	Models problems using objects. Objects contain properties and methods. Programs are made of interactions between the objects.
- Declarative
	Declarative focuses on what needs to be done and not how it can be done. Programmer specifies a result and language decides how to get it.
- Functional
	Based on maths functions. A program is made by defining and combining functions. Each function takes inputs and outputs.
