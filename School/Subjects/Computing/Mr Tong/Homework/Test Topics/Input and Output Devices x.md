## Barcodes
Used for:
- Airline baggage tracking
- Product labelling
- Ticketing and identification
- Parcel delivery and shipment
## Barcode Readers
- Work by using reflected light
- Light from the laser is directed at the barcode and the intensity of the light bouncing back is detected.
- There are two common types of barcode system:
	- Universal Product Code version "A" (UPC-A) / European Article Number (EAN)
		- Used in retail and warehousing
	- Code 128
		- Used in transport and shipment tracking
- Code 128 can be used to represent letters and numbers whilst UPC-A and EAN can only be used with numbers.
## UPC-A / EAN Systems
- Uses long guard bars to show the start and end of the barcode and also a central guard bars to show the left from the right
- UPC-A / EAN uses 7 bar elements to form four alternating dark and light bars of varying thickness, to represent each data item.

## QR (Quick Response) Codes
- 2D barcodes that can be read by smartphones or tablets.
- Can contain links to websites, or information
## Uses of QR Codes
- Restaurant coupons
- Estate agency boards
- Advertising posters
- Tourist information
- Concert tickets
- Business cards
## Digital Cameras
- A camera works in essentially the same way as a scanner.
- When a digital camera captures an image, it breaks what it sees into a grid of pixels.
	- shutter opens and lets light onto a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor at the back of the lens
	- The intensity of the light is measured by millions of tiny sensors arranged in a grid on the sensor
	- Light levels for each pixel gets represented as binary values
	- This is then stored as an image on the cameras memory
## Sensing Colour
- Red, green and blue filters are used with different sensors in the camera to separate the different wavelengths.
- The intensity of these wavelengths is stored to work out the RGB value for that pixel.
## Laser Printers
- Use dry powdered ink (toner)
	- Print drum is given a negative static charge
	- Laser shines a reverse image into the drum
	- Laser reverses the charge on the drum
	- Toner is charged negatively and sticks to the positively charged image
	- Toner is transferred from drum to paper and then fused using a heat roller

## Radio Frequency ID (RFID)
- Use a transponder and a receiver
	- Powered receiver emits radio frequency energy
	- Transponder antenna in the chip becomes energised
	- Transponder can then send data to the receiver.
## Uses of RFID Tags
- Security, identification of people, animals, goods and valuables
- Shipping and supply chain tracking for goods
- Replacement for barcode systems
- Banking and payment systems
## Passive and Active Tags
- Passive transponders, used in bank cards have no power source and rely on radio waves from the receiver for energy.
- Active tags use a larger, battery powered beacon that can broadcast its signal up to 300m away.
