## Client-server Network
- A server is a very powerful computer that provides a service or some resources to clients.
- A client is a computer that requests the services or resources from the server.
- Terminals are known "clients" of the server
## Role of the Client
- Sends requests to the server
- Waits for a reply
- Receives the reply
## Role of the Server
- The server waits for requests from the clients
- It may need to pass the request to another server, meaning the server then becomes the client to the new server.
## Client-Server Networking
Features:
- A central server that is used to manage security
- Some of the files are held in the central server
- Some processing tasks are performed by the server
- Clients issue requests to the server for services such as email, file storage, backup and printing
- Suitable for many different types of organisation, small and large
- Can require IT staff to administer the network

## Multiple Servers
- There are often many servers with specific tasks, especially in a large client-server network.
- Each one will be dedicated to a certain task:
	- Web
	- Print
	- Mail
	- File
	- Database
## Peer-to-Peer Architecture
- Has no central server

## Peer-to-Peer Networking
- Suitable for small companies with few computers
- No central server controlling the files or security
- All computers can see files on any other computer
- All computers can communicate without having to go through a central server
- If a computer switches off, data can't be retrieved

| Backup is centralised and usually automated                | Each computer on the network can act as both client and server                       |
| No access to other usersâ€™ files                            | Can be used for sharing of music and streaming coverage of live events               |
## Peer-to-Peer on a WAN
- P2P configuration can be used for file sharing websites
- BBC iPlayer uses P2P networking
- This means that even with thousands of people downloading at the same time, data can be passed between the computers rather than just from the server.
- P2P networks are also used for the illegal distribution of copyrighted materials such as music and films, as it is difficult to close them down.
