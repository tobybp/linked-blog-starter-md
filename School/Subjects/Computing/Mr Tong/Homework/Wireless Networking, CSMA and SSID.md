## The Purpose of Wi-Fi
- A wireless networking technology providing high-speed network connections and internet.
- Devices connect via a Wireless Access Point (WAP)
- Wi-Fi hotspots can often be found in public spaces such as:
	- Hotels
	- Libraries
	- Cafes
## Connecting to a Wireless Network
You will need:
- An Internet Service Provier (ISP)
- Modem and a wireless router (commonly combined)
- Device with a network interface card (NIC) also called a network interface controller.
## Wireless Components
- Wireless Network Interface Controller (WNIC / NIC)
- A station is defined as a computer with a NIC
- Stations share a channel with a radio frequency.
- Wireless Access Point (WAP) requires a connection to a router, and the router will require a connection to a modem.
	- WAP and modem are often built into the router.
## Service Set Identifier (SSID)
- Unique name given to each network.
- Must be used by all of the devices on the network.
- Can be set automatically or manually
- Can be hidden to make a network harder to detect and therefore more secure.
- Can be set to broadcast to wireless devices in range of an access point.
## Securing a Wireless Network
- Wireless networks are generally less secure than wired ones. Unauthorised users can be hard to spot and transmitted data can easily be intercepted.
- Security measures include:
	- WPA and WPA2
	- MAC address whitelists
## Two Stations Transmitting
- Several devices are able to transmit using a singular WAP.
- A protocol is needed to prevent two devices from transmitting simultaneously.
