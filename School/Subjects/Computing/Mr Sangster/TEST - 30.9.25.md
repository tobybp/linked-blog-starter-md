- A record is a **row in a file and is made up of fields**
- They are used in databases
- A **tuple** is an ordered set of values of any type
- it can’t be changed
- A static data structure's size cannot be changed
- 

| **Data Structure** | **Appropriate Usage**                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Possible use cases**                                                                                                |

| **Array**          | A fixed-size collection of elements and need random access to elements inside by index. They are efficient for accessing elements by index but less efficient for dynamic resizing of insertion/removal of elements in the middle. | List of student grades<br><br>A table of numbers for a mathematical function<br><br>A grid of pixels for an image     |
| **Records**        | A group of related data which is a single entity. They are useful for organising and manipulating data with different attributes of fields.                                                                                        | A shopping list<br><br>A to-do list<br><br>A list of contacts in an address book                                      |
| **Lists**          | A dynamic collection of elements that may change in size. They provide flexibility for adding, removing and modifying elements.                                                                                                    | A customer record in a database<br><br>A student record in a school system<br><br>A product record in an online store |
- a linked list is a dynamic data structure that is used to hold an ordered sequence
