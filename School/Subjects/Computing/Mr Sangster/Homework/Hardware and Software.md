## Hardware or Software?
A simple way to distinguish between hardware and software is that hardware is the electro-mechanical parts of a computer system, whilst software is the programs that make the computer function, such as operating systems, and applications.
##### Examples of Software:
- Android operating system
- Virus Checker
##### Examples of Hardware:
- Webcam
- RAM Memory Chip
- Microphone

## Classifying software
- Software can be classified into the following groups:
![[Software Types Diagram|600]]
## Systems Software
Systems software is required to run and manage the computer's hardware and it's application programs. For example, systems software can manage peripherals, install software, check for viruses, and allocate jobs to the processor.
## Operating Systems
An operating system serves as a middle man between the software and the hardware of the device. Software applications cannot talk directly to the hardware. 
	Some examples of operating systems are Windows, MacOS, Android and Linux.
## Utility Software
Utility software is designed in order to maintain, optimise, configure and analyse a computer system. 
	This could be things such as defragmenting a disk, installing or uninstalling software, keeping software versions up to date, and monitoring resources and performance.
Utilities perform common tasks that are needed by most or all users will need.
Examples include:
	Virus checkers
	Automatic backup and restore
	File compression software in order to reduce file size before transmission to another device.
## Libraries
A library is a collection of pre-compiled routines that can be used by other programs
	These libraries are often used to save time by not having to rewrite code.
	Examples in Python are math, random, and turtle.
	Most programming languages have similar libraries.
#### Operating System Libraries
Most operating systems will have hundreds of library files that can be shared by multiple processes
	Within windows, the extension files have the extension: .dll
## Translators and Machine Code
Machine code is the lowest for of instructions that you can give a computer. It consists of pure binary.
	All instructions that a computer is given need to be converted into machine code before they can be run.
This is where translators are required. A translator is used to translate code written in assembly language or a similar high level coding language, into machine code.
#### Types of Translator
- Assemblers - Translate assembly language into machine code.
- Compilers - Translate high-level language programs into machine code that can be saved and run when needed, without needing the compiler to be present.
- Interpreters - These also translate high-level language programs.
Translators are not classified as utility programs despite having many of the features that they provide.
## Application Software
Application software is software that allows you to perform different tasks, these can be general use and special use.
	Examples of application software include: word processors, image editors, email clients and internet browsers.
## Application Software Categories
![[Application Software Categories|300]]
## General Purpose
General purpose software packages can be used to perform a range of generic tasks.
Examples:
	Word Processors
	Graphics Packages
	Spreadsheet software
**NOTE: DO NOT USE BRAND NAMES IN EXAMS!!!**
(Do not say Microsoft Word, say word processors. Or do not say Excel, say spreadsheet Software.)

## Special Purpose
Special purpose software that performs tasks for a singular, specific job.
Examples:
	Media players
	Calendar programs
	Online payment systems
## Off-the-shelf
Special purpose software can be either off-the-shelf, or bespoke. The term off the shelf originates from when you would buy physical copies of software from a store, in the form of a USB stick or CD.
Benefits of off-the-shelf software is that it will have been thoroughly tested and tried, so there will be very few bugs. And there will likely be more frequent updates.
However, some drawbacks are that it may not do exactly what you need, and may have additional functions that you will not use, therefore taking up excess space on your computer.
## Bespoke Software
Created to fulfil a customer's exact needs and specifications.
	This will likely significantly increase the cost.
	It will take weeks, months or years for the software to be developed.
	Provides you with complete control over the process and gives every aspect of functionality needed.
