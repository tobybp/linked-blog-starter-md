- Adding the LDR allows the resistance of the circuit to vary with light intensity.
- As light intensity decreases, the resistance of the LDR increases
- The p.d. across the LDR (and the lamp) increases
- The p.d. across R  decreases
- The lamp switches on
- The total resistance is increasing 
- The total current decreases

#### Temperature Controller
![[Thermistor Circuit 6.1.25]]
- As the temperature drops, the resistance of the thermistor increases. 
- The heater will begin to heat up. 
- This will increase the temperature, and eventually reduce the resistance of the thermistor so that the heater turns off. 
- This results in a negative feedback loop that keeps the area at a constant temperature.
