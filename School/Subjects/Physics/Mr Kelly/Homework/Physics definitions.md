## Definitions & Laws Recall Test – Electricity – part 1
## Current
Rate of flow of charge.
## The Amp
1 = 1 coulomb or charge passing a point per second.
## Potential difference
Energy stored per unit charge.
## The Volt
1 = 1 joule per coulomb of charge.
## Resistance
Potential difference per unit current.
## The Ohm
1 volt per unit amp
## State Kirchhoff’s First Law and the quantity conserved
The total sum of all currents that enter a point in a circuit is equal to the total sum of all currents that leave the same point around a closed loop.
Quantity conserved
In a closed loop, all charge must be conserved as it flows around the loop. The law of conservation of charge states this fact.
