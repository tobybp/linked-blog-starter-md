A kettle is rated at 2kW and can take five minutes to boil the water inside. The energy transferred during this heating process is:
E = P x t     = 2000 x (5 x 60) = 600,000J

The values become quite large, quite quickly. Now consider how much electrical energy is transferred in a typical household during the day...

A more convenient unit is known as the **KiloWatt-Hour**

This means we use power in kilowatts and time in hours, rather than using smaller units of the watt and seconds. This is still a unit of energy.
#### Definition
A KiloWatt-hour is the **energy transferred** by a 1kW electrical device when operating for 1 hour.

1kWh = 1000 x 60 x 60
**= 3,600,000J** 

A "unit" of 1kWh is measured using domestic and industrial meters for electrical supplies.
An electrical meter tallies up the energy transferred as units.
The number of units transferred (per month or quarter = 3 months) form part of an electricity bill.

#### Practice Questions
1) 60 x 7200 = 432,000J
2) 875 x 12 = 10,500p
3) 1kWh = 1000 x 60 x 60 = 3,600,000
4) a) 9000 x 15 x 60 = 8,100,000
	b) 8,100,000 / 3,600,000 = 2.25 kWh
5) 5 x 7 x 24 x 60 x 60 = 3,024,000 x 60 = 181,440,000 / 3,600,000 = 50.4 kWh 50.4 x 11.2 = 564.48p = Â£5.64
6) 100 / 1000 = 0.1kWh x 2 x 365 x 18 = 1314 kWh
	15 / 1000 = 0.015 x 2 x 365 x 18 = 197.1 kWh
	1314 - 197.1 = 1,116.9
