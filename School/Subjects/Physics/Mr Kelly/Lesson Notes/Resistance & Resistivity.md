We know, that in resistance:
Resistance is directly proportional (∝) to the length of the conductor.
R ∝ L

Also, resistance and cross-sectional area (CSA), the resistance is directly proportional to 1 / cross-sectional-area
R ∝ 1/A

So, R ∝ L/A
Resistivity is a constant of proportionality and is given the symbol, rho (ρ)
Therefore R = ρL / A
ρ = RA / L         Units: Ωm
Definition of resistivity is the product of resistance and cross-sectional-area per unit length.

## Investigating Resistivity

ρ = RA / L
- Measure the diameter of the wire. (across various points and take an average)
- Determine the cross-sectional-area of the wire, using the CSA.
- Measure the length of the wire.
- Set up the circuit
![[Testing resitance of unknown material]]
- Vary the p.d and measure the current in a suitable table
- Plot a suitable graph.
- Determine, from the graph, the resistance of the wire.
