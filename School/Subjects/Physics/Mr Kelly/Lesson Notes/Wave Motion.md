`This topic explores the way energy is transferred or stored through different media.`
#### Transverse Waves
==Transverse waves== are where ==energy== is transferred ==perpendicular== to the direction of ==vibration==
All electromagnetic waves are transverse
#### Longitudinal Waves
==Longitudinal waves== are where ==energy== is transferred ==parallel== to the direction of ==vibration==
Sound waves are longitudinal

In this topic, we will look at both transverse and longitudinal waves.
When energy is transferred from one point to another, this is known as a progressive wave formation

| Time period  | T      | s    | The time taken for one complete oscillation or the time taken for the wave to move one whole wavelength |
| Frequency    | f      | Hz   | The number of complete oscillations per unit time                                                       |
### T = 1/f

## The Wave Equation
Wave speed = frequency x wavelength (v = fλ)
v = f x λ
This is derived from combining the definition of frequency travelled per cycle wavelength
(frequency = 1 / time period) x (wavelength = distance travelled per cycle)
= distance travelled by cycle / time period
= distance / time
= speed (in meters per second)
