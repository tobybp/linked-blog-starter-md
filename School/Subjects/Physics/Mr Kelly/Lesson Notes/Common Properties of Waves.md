##### These properties listed are all common amongst waves
- Reflection
- Refraction
- Diffraction
- Polarisation
##### And for transverse electromagnetic waves
- Can all travel through a vacuum
- Can all travel at the same speed (of light) = 3.0 x 10$^8$ m/s
## Wave properties (reflection)
Reflection is a change in direction for a wave due to it striking a surface.
The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence measured from a normal to the surface is equal to the angle of reflection and that the incident ray, reflected ray and normal are in the same plane.
