The initial measurement (open switch) is the "e.m.f" of the battery (electromotive force). The e.m.f is the potential difference available due to the battery on open circuit.
The second measurement is the closed circuit potential difference available from the battery. The potential difference on closed circuit is always less than the e.m.f due to "lost volts" across the internal resistance of the battery
## Internal Resistance
Consider a "real" battery to be cells in series with a resistor of resistance "r".

- The potential difference across the cells is E, the e.m.f of the battery.
- The potential difference across the internal resistance is Ir (from V = IR)
- The potential difference available for the rest of the circuit V = E - Ir
- The quantity Ir is sometimes referred to as the "lost volts" due to the internal resistance of the battery.
