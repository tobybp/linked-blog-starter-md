### Resistance
Resistance within a circuit is due to the flow of charge becoming restricted (collisions with ions etc)
#### Resistance is defined as the **==potential difference per unit current.==**

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
#### R = V / I
Where:
	R = Resistance
	V = Potential Difference
	I = Current

Real Value: 6.8Ω
Experimental Value: 7.473Ω
Percentage Difference = -9.9%

Real Value: 15Ω
Experimental Value: 18.01Ω
Percentage Difference = -20.07%

Percentage difference calculation:
((Real value - experimental value) / Real value) x 100

The unit of resistance is the **ohm, Ω**
### ==1 Ohm is defined as 1 Volt per unit Amp==
