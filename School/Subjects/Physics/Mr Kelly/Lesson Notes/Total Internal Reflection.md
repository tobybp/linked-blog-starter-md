#### Total Internal Reflection (TIR) only occurs under these conditions:
- The angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle
- Refractive index of the incident media > refractive index of the adjacent media.
- i.e **n***glass* > **n***air*
The critical angle for an air boundary can be found using the formula:
sinC = 1/n

## Optical Fibres
They are designed to totally internally reflect the pulses of visible light travelling through them. Most commonly used for transmitting data for fast broadband connections and images from inside patients undergoing keyhole surgery. A simpler optical fibre has a fine glass core surrounded by a glass cladding with a lower refractive index. Light travelling through fibre is contained within the core because of total internal refection. Simple optical fibres are step indexed. The refractive index changes suddenly between the core and cladding, and between the cladding and the air. When plotted on a graph of refractive index against distance across the fibre, the refractive index changes as a series of steps.
