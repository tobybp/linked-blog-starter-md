- A progressive wave is one where there is a net transfer of energy and nodes and antinodes move position along the wave medium.
- A stationary wave is one where there is not net transfer of energy and nodes and antinodes have fixed position.

- Stationary waves are sometimes described as examples of resonance.
- Resonance occurs when an object is forced to vibrant at its natural frequency. This leads to a significant increase in the amplitude of vibrations.
- Stationary waves are also a specific example of constructive interference.
- Stringed instruments depend on standing waves to resonate at specific frequencies.
## How are stationary waves formed
- Examples of this are shown in the vibrating string demonstration, using Melde's string apparatus
	- Initially, the vibrating end causes an incident progressive wave to travel along the string.
	- The fixed end then reflects the incident progressive wave
	- Upon reflection the wave changes phase
	- The reflected progressive wave then interferes with the incident progressive wave.
	- The two progressive waves interfere wit one another
	- Incident wave interferes with the reflected wave
	- These form areas of constructive. and destructive interference
	- Constructive interference causes antinodes to appear
	- Destructive interference causes nodes to appear
	- Neither the nodes or antinodes progress along the string; they are stationary
	- No net transfer of energy takes place
### First Harmonic (fundamental)
- The first harmonic is the lowest frequency possible in a stationary wave and is known as fundamental frequency, f0. The wave has a length equal to one half a wavelength.
### Second harmonic
- The second harmonic has a frequency equal to two fundamental frequencies, i.e. 2f0. THe wave has a length equal to one wavelength.
## Third Harmonic
- The third harmonic has a frequency equal to three fundamental frequencies, i.e. 3f0. The wave has a length equal to one and a half wavelengths.
### Fourth Harmonic
- The fourth harmonic has a frequency equal to four fundamental frequencies, i.e. 4f0/ The wave has a length equal to two wavelengths
