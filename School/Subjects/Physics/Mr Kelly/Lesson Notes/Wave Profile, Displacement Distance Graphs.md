	A = down
	D = up
3) Practical
	- Set up oscilloscope and microphone.
	- Play the whistle into the microphone
	- Adjust settings of oscilloscope appropriately to display the wave
	- Take a picture and measure the frequency 
4) wavespeed = frequency x wavelength
	frequency = wavespeed / wavelength
	frequency = 340 / 2.0
	frequency = 170hz
