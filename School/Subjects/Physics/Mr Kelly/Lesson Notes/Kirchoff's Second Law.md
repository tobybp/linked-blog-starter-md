The "emf's" is the potential difference across the ideal cells.

Where ε is the _emf_ of the cells
V is the p.d around the circuit loop
Σ represents "the sum of"

Measurement on voltmeter as seen above: 
R1 = 0.12V
R2 = 2.52V
Both resistors = 2.64V
Both Cells = 2.64V
R1 + R2 = 2.64V

### Observations so far
The sum of the potential difference across the two cells is identical to the potential difference across the resistors added together.

With a 3rd resistor, the p.d across the two cells is 2.69V
R1 = 0.05V
R2 = 1.04V
R3 = 1.59V
1.59 + 1.04 + 0.05 = 2.68V total
The potential difference across all of the resistors is still equal to the potential difference across the cells

## Conclusion
The potential difference around the two resistors, will sum to the total potential difference, across the cells. This does not matter according to the size of the resistors.
Some of the energy in the circuit is lost to heat through the cells. This is why sometimes the values don't add up. The energy from the cells is conserved in the energy transferred to the resistors.
