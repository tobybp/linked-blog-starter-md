`Refraction` is a change of direction (bending) for a wave due to a change in the speed of the wave due to a change in the density of the medium that it is travelling within.
This can be explained by a `wave model`.
![[WaveModel 27.1.25]]
If the wave hits the boundary between two densities at an angle that is not equal to 90 degrees, (0 to the normal) one edge of each wavefront is slowed down before the other and this causes the wave to bend.
## Refractice index
The light enters the glass and slows down; different materials will reduce the speed of light by different amount and the measure of this is known as the refractive index.
It is calcuated by comparing the speed of light in a vacuum (a constant) to the speed of light through the medium.
the formula used is n = c/v
where n is the refractice index (dimensionless)
c is the speed of light in a vacuum (=3 x 10$^8$ m/s)
v is the speed of light in the medium (medium dependant)
