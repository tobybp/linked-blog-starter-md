## De Broglie
- Prince Lois de Broglie was an advocate of the photon model of electromagnetic radiation adn added to this theory by discussing photon behavious as a particle being transferred via carrier waves.
- de Broglie suggested that all "objects" exhibit a wave/particle duality of behaviour"
## Electron Diffraction
- If large scale particles might be able to exhibit some sort of wave-particle duality, then perhaps the place to start if with looking at sub-atomic particles.
- Electrons are particles because
	- They have mass and charge.
	- They can be accelerated by potential differences.
- Electrons are waves
	- If they diffract
