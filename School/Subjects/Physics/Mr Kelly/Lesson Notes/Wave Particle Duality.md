## De Broglie
- Prince Lois de Broglie was an advocate of the photon model of electromagnetic radiation adn added to this theory by discussing photon behavious as a particle being transferred via carrier waves.
- de Broglie suggested that all "objects" exhibit a wave/particle duality of behaviour"
## Electron Diffraction
- If large scale particles might be able to exhibit some sort of wave-particle duality, then perhaps the place to start if with looking at sub-atomic particles.
- Electrons are particles because
	- They have mass and charge.
	- They can be accelerated by potential differences.
- Electrons are waves
	- If they diffract
## The Electron Gun
- hot cathode produces electrons due to thermionic emission
- Electron accelerated in vacuum tube by applying a p.d between cathode (-) an anode (+)
- Electrons pass through the carbon  and diffract. 
- The spacing between the carbon lattice acts as a diffraction grating
- The diffraction "rings" on the screen are a 3D diffraction pattern, similar to what we have seen with a LASER.
- de Broglie suggested that it would appear that electrons do fit in with the wave behaviour as explained by Young. Therefore electrons have a wave nature even though they are particles.
## de Broglie's Relationship
- de Broglie stated that all particles have an associated wavelength which can be calculated using the relationship:
	- λ ∝ 1/P
	- λ = h/p
	- gives λ = h / mv      v = E/Q      Ek = QV     = eV     = 1.6 x 10$^{-19}$ x 2600 Ek = 4.16 x 10$^{-16}$
	- λ = de Broglie wavelength
	- h = Planck constant
	- p = momentum
- Ek = 1/2mv$^2$
- v = sqrt(Ek / 1/2m)
- = sqrt(2Ek / m)
- = sqrt(2 x 4.16 x 10$^{-16}$ / 9.11 x 10$^{-31}$) 
- 3.02 x 10$^{7}$m/s
6.63 x 10$^{-34}$ / 9.11 x 10$^{-31}$ x 3.02 x 10$^{7}$

## Diffracting through a door
λ = h / mv = 6.63 x 10$^{-34}$ / 78 x u
λ = 1m
u = 6.63 x 10$^{-34}$ / 1x78 = 8.5 x 10$^{-36}$
