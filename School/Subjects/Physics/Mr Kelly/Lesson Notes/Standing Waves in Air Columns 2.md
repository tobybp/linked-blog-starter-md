Using a similar idea to Kundt's tube, we can investigate standing waves in open-ended air columns 
- Tuning fork provides vibrations
- Vibrations pass down the tube
- They reflect at the air/water boundary and resonate
- A series of nodes and antinodes are set up within the tube
- By adjusting the height of the pipe, the sound waves will resonate when the pipe is exactly 1/4λ

## Question time
1) We took repeat measurements to find the length of the effective tube for each frequency, calculated a mean for all of the measurements of the speed of light
2) 
	The uncertainty in frequency measurements is  ±0.1 Hz.
	The uncertainty in wavelength is ±0.001 m
3) 
	Δf≈0.1 Hz
	Δλ≈0.001m
	f = 320 Hz, λ = 1.0 v = 307 m/s
	Δv ≈ 0.00104 × 307 ≈ 0.319m/s
	±0.32 m/s.
4) 
	(307+309+307+300+311+309+301+298)​ / 8 = 305.25 m/s
	305.25m/s is significantly lower than the accepted value of 343m/s. This suggests that there are systematic errors.
