### LEDs and the Planck Constant
LEDs convert electrical energy into light energy. They emit light above a critical value. When the threshold is exceeded the LED emits photons of a specific wavelength. At the p.d. the work done is given by W = VQ. This energy is around the same as the energy of the emitted photon. A voltmeter is used to measure the minimum p.d. required to turn on the LED.
Threshold p.d. x charge on electron = energy of emitted photon 
	Ve = hf
Expressing this in terms of the wavelength of the emitted photon λ gives:
	eV = hc / λ
This equation can be used to find h using a single LED, but using a variety of different wavelength LEDs gives a more accurate value.
We can plot a graph of V against 1/λ. The equation y = mx + c is equivalent of V = hc / λe
The Planck constant can be determined from the gradient of the graph hc / e
