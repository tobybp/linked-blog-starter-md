### LEDs and the Planck Constant
LEDs convert electrical energy into light energy. They emit light above a critical value. When the threshold is exceeded the LED emits photons of a specific wavelength. At the p.d. the work done is given by W = VQ. This energy is around the same as the energy of the emitted photon. A voltmeter is used to measure the minimum p.d. required to turn on the LED.
Threshold p.d. x charge on electron = energy of emitted photon
