#### Definition:
ElectronVolt (eV) - The work done or the energy an electron gains (or loses) when accelerated by a potential difference of 1 Volt.

The electronvolt (eV) is a unit of energy.

From the definition for p.d (the work done per unit charge) we could say that:
work done = charge x potential difference
W = q x V

Work done on electron W:
	W = qV = (1.6 x 10$^{-19}$C)(1 J/C)
	W = 1 electron volt = 1.6 x 10$^{-19}$J

## Photoelectric Effect
#### Observations
- White light seems to have no effect, either the frequency or intensity
- UV seems to discharge the plate, regardless of intensity
- Particle model of light theorised
- leads to the photoelectric equation
#### Einstein's Theory
- A **photon** (particle) of light is absorbed by the **surface** of the metal plate
- The **energy** carried by this **photon** is determined by E = hf
- #### **One surface electron absorbs one photon (one-to-one interaction)**
- If the **incident** energy is sufficient, the electron is **liberated** (leaves the surface)
- This energy is known as the **workfunction energy φ**
- E > φ = KEₘₐₓ of the ejected electron
- The ejected electron is known as a **photoelectron**
### Questions
- What if E = φ or E < φ? 
	
- Intensity; increasing the no. of photons increases energy?
	No, the energy of the photon is depicted by E = hf
	The intensity is only affecting the number of photons.
- Metal surface?
- Type of metal?
- Why UV and not visible light?
