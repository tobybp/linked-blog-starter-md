#### Definition:
ElectronVolt (eV) - The work done or the energy an electron gains (or loses) when accelerated by a potential difference of 1 Volt.

The electronvolt (eV) is a unit of energy.

From the definition for p.d (the work done per unit charge) we could say that:
work done = charge x potential difference
W = q x V
