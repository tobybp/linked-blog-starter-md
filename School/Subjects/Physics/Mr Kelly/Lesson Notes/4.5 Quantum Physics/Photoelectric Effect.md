## The photon (quanta of energy)
- Incident radiation is considered a "wave" of continuous energy
- Switch on a filament lamp, visible and infra-red waves are emitted in a continuous stream of energy (or are they?)
- The concept of the photon was first considered to help explain certain experimental results.
## Coulomb-meter findings
- The white plastic charges negatively
- The clear plastic (pyrex) charges positively
## Gold-leaf Electroscope
- The gold leaf and the stem of the electroscope deflect away from each other with both the white and clear plastic charging rods.
- The gold leaf repels away from the stem when they both become the same positive/negative charge.
## Photoelectric Effect (background)
- Max Planck has discovered a link between energy and frequency of electromagnetic energy in the late 1800's.
- This gave rise to the equation:
	E = hf (hence the Planck constant of proportionality)
	Energy of electromagnetic radiation = Planck constant x Frequency
	h = $6.63$ x $10^{-34}$Js
## The energy of a photon
- The energy of a photon is determined using the equation:
	E = hf = hc/λ (from wavespeed equation v = fλ)
	where:
		E = energy of the incident photon
		h = Plancks constant
		f = frequency of incident radiation
		λ = wavelength of incident radiation
		c = speed of light in a vacuum
