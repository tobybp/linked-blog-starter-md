1. Check whether it is an s-t or v-t graph!
2. State the relationship(s) you will use to interpret the graph:
3. Mark the sections where the motion has common properties
4. Describe the motion. Think about: 
	- The direction (or sign) of each quantity
	- Whether the quantity is constant, increases or decreases
	- Whether any increase or decrease is linear or non linear
	- Include values where appropriate

## Dropping a ball
Sketch the displacement-time and velocity-time graphs for a ball being dropped (from release to ball hitting ground). Origin is at the level of the ground, positive displacement is upwards.
