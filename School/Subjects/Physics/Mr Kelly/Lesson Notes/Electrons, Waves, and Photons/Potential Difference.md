The potential energy building up on the dome is the result of the net energy of all the electrons trapped on it.
### Potential difference is defined as the energy stored per unit charge and is measured in Volts, V

The greater the energy per electron the greater the potential difference (p.d) in Volts

### 1 Volt is equal to 1 Joule per Coulomb of charge.
### V = E/Q
V = Potential difference
E = Energy stored
Q = Charge
