### Charging By Friction
- Polythene gains negatively charged electrons from the cloth when charged by friction.
- The polythene traps/stores the negative charge (static electricity)
- Acetate loses negatively charged electrons to the cloth when charged by friction.

Taking the Van Der Graaf Generator as an example, the net charge that builds up on the dome depends on the number of charges present.

#### Results:

| Plastic   | Charge   |     |
| --------- | -------- | --- |
| Polythene | Negative |     |
| Acetate   | Positive |     |
