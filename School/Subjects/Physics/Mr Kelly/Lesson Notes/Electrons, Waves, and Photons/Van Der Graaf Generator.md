- Metal sphere is insulated from surroundings using plastic supports.
- "free electrons" are generated using the high voltage supply and by friction with the roller.
- These free electrons are carried by the roller and deposited onto the metal dome
- They become "trapped" and build up in charge and potential.
- Each electron carries a charge of $1.6x10^19$C.
- The potential energy/difference of each electron depends on the high voltage supply and friction with the roller.
