### Conclusions:
- The larger the resistor, the smaller the current. (The 33Ω gave 0.1 A)
- Ideally, the current in the 1Ω resistor is x10 larger than the 10Ω resistor.
	- However, in practice, it is only 2x larger, because some energy is lost as heat.
- The larger the resistance, the larger value of potential difference (p.d)
	- The electrons require more energy, (larger potential difference), to push through the larger resistances.
