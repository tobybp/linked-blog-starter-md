![[Electron Flow Model in Wire.png|600]]


1. Electrons flow and carry negative charge (charge carriers).
2. They are motivated to move by a potential difference across the conductor.
3. The faster they flow, the more charge that is transferred.
4. The current increases as the flow of charge increases.

### We define current as ==**"the rate of flow of charge"**== and it is measured in amperes where ==**1A means 1 Coulomb of charge passing a point per second.**==

5. Collisions between the electrons and nuclei slow down the electrons by removing energy from them. This is a model for "resistance". 
6. The electron's path is therefore a **==zig-zag==** random one (due to the collisions with the conductors ions). ==**Sporadic movement**==
7. If the temperature of the wire increases, the nuclei vibrate more and collisions are more likely. There will therefore be more resistance and less current for the same potential difference.
8. A longer conductor means more nuclei to pass and more collisions will take place. A longer conductor will mean more resistance and less current with the same potential difference.
