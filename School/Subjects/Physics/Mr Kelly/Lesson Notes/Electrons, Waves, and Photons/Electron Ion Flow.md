Outline: Electron flow, ion flow, conventional current and potatoes

### Electrolysis of CuSO₄
- Set up apparatus
- You will be given CuSO₄ solution
- It will be 0.5 molar
- Note the current size
- Note the current direction
![[Electrolysis of CuSO4 practical|600]]
#### CuSO₄ Conclusion:
The positively charged copper collects at the negative cathode due to opposites attracting. Therefore, the negatively charged sulphate is attracted to the positive anode.
#### NaSO₄ Conclusion:
Substantial fizzing at anode, quite a lot of fizzing at cathode, slow decrease in current from 0.23, down to 0.10.
#### NaCl Conclusion:
Lots of fizzing at the cathode, and minimal fizzing at the anode. No change in current.
#### CaCl Conclusion:
Slight increase in current, from 0.21 to 0.22. Slight fizzing at the anode, and no fizzing at the cathode.

# Potato / Fruit cell investigation
- Set up the apparatus
- You will be given various metals
- Try different combinations
- Note the current
- Note the current polarity
- Anything else to note?
