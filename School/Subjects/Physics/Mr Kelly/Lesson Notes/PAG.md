distance = 1.84m
x2 = (9.5 x 10$^{-3}$) / 1.811 = 5.16 x 10$^{-3}$
tan$^{-1}$(5.16 x 10$^{-3}$) = 0.296
(2.4 x 10$^{-4}$ x sin(0.296)) / 2 = 6.2 x 10$^{-7}$
wavelength = 620 nanometers

8) x2 measurement is closer to the actual value
9) x2 has an uncertainty of 5%, compared to the 10.3% of x1, therefore x2 has the least uncertainty
10) Using a microscope with a scale
11) It would make the diffraction pattern wider, and increase the distance between the dots.
12) The dots would be closer
13) It would be a vertical array of dots
14) There would be lots of different diffraction patterns due to the different components of white light having different wavelengths.
