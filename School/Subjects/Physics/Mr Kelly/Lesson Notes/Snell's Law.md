- The relationship between incident and refracted rays of Em radiation (light) as it passes from one medium to another is given above.
- n1 = refractive index of medium 1
- n2 = refractive index of medium 2
- This is also written in the form :
	n1sinθ1 = n2sinθ2
n1 = C/Vair       Vair roughly equal to C
nair = 1, because the speed of light in the air is virtually the same as in a vacuum.
In the air/material experiments, Snell's Law
sinθ1 = n2sinθ2 
### Using own values
nglass = 1.59
3x10^8 / 1.59
### Worked Example:
A ry of light travels from water to crown glass (a glass often used to make lenses) the light strikes the boundary between the two at an angle of 40 degrees to the normal. Calculate the angle of refraction.
#### Step 1: Identify the correct equation to use
nsinθ = k
Apply this equation to a ray of light travelling from water into glass.
(nwater)(Sinθwater) = (nglass)(sinθglass)
Rearrange for sinθglass
sinθglass = ((nwater)(sinθwater)) / (nglass)
#### Step 2: Substitute the known values and calculate sinθglass (make sure your calculator is in degree mode)
sinθglass = (1.33 x sin40) / 1.52
= 0.562
θglass = 34.2
This angle is less than 40 degrees, as the light as slowed down when it entered the glass from the water, bending towards the normal.
## Summary Questions
1) Describe the relationship between refractive index and the speed of light through a material.
	The speed of light through a material is inversely proportional to the refractive index of it. The larger the refractive index of the material, the slower light travels through it.
2) The speed of light in ethanol is measured as 220 x 10$^6$ ms$^{-1}$. Calculate the refractive index of ethanol.
