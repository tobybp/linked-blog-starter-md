## A Couple

Unless the line of action of a force passes through the centre of mass, it produces a turning effect (moment).
#### To make an object spin **without any linear acceleration**, we apply a couple. A couple is defined as **a pair of parallel, equal and opposite forces separated by a distance.**

Catherine Wheel
If only one rocket fires, the Catherine wheel will spin and accelerate upwards:
Spins because force does not act through centre of mass
Accelerates upwards because there is a resultant force.

Moment = Fd / 2 + Fd / 2 = Fd
called torque

## Using torque
1) A snooker ball is resting on a table. A single off-centre force is applied to its surface with a cue. Describe the subsequent motion of the ball.
	It will move forwards but at an angle as there was an uneven force applied to it. The ball will also spin.
2) The top of a kitchen tap has a diameter 4.0cm. Estimate the torque required. to open such a tap using your thumb and one of the other fingers.

3) Figure 5 shows two discs placed on a smooth horizontal surface, describe qualitatively the type of motion each disk will perform.
	a will spin clockwise, b will spin anticlockwise.
4) a
	moment = (F x (d + x)) - F * x
	moment = Fd + Fx - Fx = Fd
	b
	The moment about A is the same as the torque of the couple.
## Center of Mass
A tele-cabin is moving horizontally and decelerating. It hangs by a support arm at an angle of 10 degrees to the vertical. The mass of the tele-cabin and its occupants is 1300kg.
#### Centre of Gravity & Centre of Mass
Centre of gravity:
The point from which the weight of a body or system may be considered to act.
In a uniform gravitational field it is con-located with the:
Centre of mass: A point through which any externally applied force produces straight-line motion but no rotation.
