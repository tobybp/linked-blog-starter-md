## Summary Questions
1) With examples, outline why it is necessary for different power sources to have different internal resistances. (3 marks)
	Having a low internal resistance allows for high current, which can be useful. However, having a high internal resistance, means that the current will be lowered greatly. This can be useful for protecting things such as children.
2) Describe what happens to the terminal p.d. from a power source as the current through the source increases. (2 marks)
	As the current through the source increases, the terminal p.d. decreases
3) A 9.0V battery with an internal resistance of 2.0 ohms is connected in series with a filament lamp. The lamp draws a current of 1.5A. Calculate:
	a) The lost volts;
		= I x r
		= 2 x 1.5
		= 3V
	b) The terminal p.d;
		9 - 3
		= 6V
	c) The energy lost per second by the battery;
		I$^2$ x r
		1.5$^2$ x 2 = 4.5V
	d) The resistance of the lamp;
		6/1.5
		= 4 ohms
4) A 12V battery with an unknown internal resistance is connected with three resistors. If the current through the cell is 0.10A calculate:
	a) The total resistance of the resistor circuit;
		1/90 + 1/45
		1/90 + 2/90
		=3/90
		=90/3 = 30ohms
		+ 50 = 80 ohms total.
	b) The terminal p.d. and the lost volts;
		0.1 x 80 = 8V
	c) The internal resistance of the battery;
		12-8 = 4 ohms
