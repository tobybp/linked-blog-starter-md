- The hot filament produces a cloud of delocalised electrons through a process of thermal ionisation (thermionic emission)
- We assume the electrons initially have negligible kinetic energy
- The electrons carry a negative charge and are accelerated towards the positive anode, inside the vacuum tube.
- The electrons pass through the anode and are absorbed by the fluorescent screen.
##### Recall
Potential difference is the energy stored per unit charge
Therefore, V = E/Q (the charge per electron is given the symbol e = 1.6 x 10$^{-19}$)
-> E = VQ
-> E = Ve
Energy gained by e$^{-}$ = eV = 1/2mv$^2$ 
2ev = mv$^2$ 
(2ev / m) = v$^2$ 
Sqrt(2ev / m) = v
V = 3.2kW
e = -1.6 x 10$^{-19}$ 
m = 9.11 x 10$^{-31}$ 
Ve = 3.4 x 10$^7$ m/s
c = 3.0 x 10$^8$ m/s        roughly 11-12%
## Practice Questions
1a) ![[NTCGraph|500]]
1b) The resistance will decrease as the light intensity increases. The ammeter will show an increase in current due to the formula I = V / R. The Voltmeter will show no change, as the ammeter increases and the resistance decrease, causing the multiplication to give the same result.

2a) Both are measured in volts, but the electromotive force is the transfer of energy throughout the circuit but the potential difference is just a portion of energy between any two points.

2b) V = J/C
	C = J/V
	C = 100 / 1.5
	C = 66.67

2c) KE = 1/2 x 9.1 x 10$^{-31}$ x (10,000)$^2$ = 4.55 x 10$^{-22}$ J
3a) Resistance = (pL) / A
(Ωm x m) / m$^2$ 
m's cancel out, left with only Ω
