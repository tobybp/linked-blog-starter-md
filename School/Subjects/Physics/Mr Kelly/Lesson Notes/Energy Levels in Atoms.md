- When a low density gas is "excited" by a large potential difference, it glows, emitting light/electromagnetic radiation.
- If this light is passed through a spectrometer, the light from the gas can be split into a spectrum which can be observed to consist of discrete lines (wavelengths)![[Excalidraw/energylevelsinatoms.md|600]]
- The arrangement of wavelengths of light that originates from a specific gas element is unique to it, like a finger-print, like a finger-print is to a human being.
- Quantum theory suggests that this arrangement of light originates from the electrons in the atoms within the gas. The electrons gain energy due to the potential difference and then, moments later, irradiate it as an electromagnetic "wave" (proton).
- Because of the specific wavelengths that are emitted, this is evidence to suggest that in isolated atoms discrete energy levels`(quantum physics)`exist which the electrons are limited to be within.
