When a low density gas is "excited" by a large potential difference, it glows, emitting light/electromagnetic radiation.
If this light is passed through a spectrometer, the light from te gas can be split into a spectrum which can be observed to consist of discrete lines (wavelengths)![[Excalidraw/energylevelsinatoms.md]]
