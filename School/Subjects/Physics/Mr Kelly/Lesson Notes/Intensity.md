Intensity is defined as:
	The power delivered **per unit** cross-sectional area.
This can be represented by the equation I = P/A 
	I = Intensity (Wm$^{-2}$)
	P = Power delivered (W)
	A = cross-sectional area (m$^2$)
We also know that:
	Power = energy transferred / time taken
Therefore I = E/At
## Intensity and inverse-square law
Consider a point source of light, emitting energy in all directions equally
![[pointsource]]
Radial emitter of light (i.e a sphere)
Recall: Surface area of a sphere = 4(pi)r$^2$
therefore I = P/A = P / 4(pi)r$^2$
I fishsign I/R$^2$
r = distance *(or radius)*

## Practical
zero error = 10.5

The graph obeys the inverse square rule, as the energy twice as far from the source, has a quarter of the intensity. It also covers 4x the area that it would.
