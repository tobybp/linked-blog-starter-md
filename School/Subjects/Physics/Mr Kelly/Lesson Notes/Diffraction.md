## Wave Properties (diffraction)
Diffraction is the spreading out of wavefronts as they pass around or through a barrier or an aperture \[Huygen-Fresnel Principle].
This diagram shows how waves approaching the aperture are diffracted.

- Diffraction occurs the most (most curved pattern) when the size of the aperture is equal to the wavelength of the incident wave.
## Summary Questions
3) Because the wavelength of light is far smaller than that of sound.
4) The wavelength of 3m will have its maximum diffraction, due to the aperture being the size of the wavelength. The 3cm wave will have a smaller diffraction, but only at the edges, see figure 1 above.
5) Because they are long wavelengths, they can be diffracted by wider apertures, and therefore it will be diffracted down into the valley.
6) a) wavelength = wavespeed /
