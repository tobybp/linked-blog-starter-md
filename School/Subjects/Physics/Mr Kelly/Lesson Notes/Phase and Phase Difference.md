Phase is a measure of the fraction of a complete oscillation.
One complete oscillation is equivalent to an angle of 360 degrees.
Phase difference is a measure of the fraction of a complete oscillation that one wave leads or lags.
For example, point L is 90 degrees leading point P.
Point P is 180 degrees lagging point S, or point P is 180 degrees leading point S.
Point L is 270 degrees leading point T.
Point P leads 90 degrees point Q

## Degrees and Radians
One complete oscillation of a wave is equivalent to one complete revolution on a circle.
A radian is the fraction of a circumference equal to the radius of a circle.
Therefore I have 2 pi radians in one complete revolution.
So 360 degrees is equal to 2 pi radians.
Hint: always leave radian measure in fractions of pi.

| Degrees | Radians |
| ------- | ------- |
| 0       | 0       |
| 90      | 1/2π    |
| 180     | 1π      |
| 270     | 3/2π    |
| 360     | 2π      |
From degrees to radians, we divide by 360, and multiply by 2π.
From radians to degrees, we divide by 2π, the multiply by 360.
