## The photon (quanta of energy)
- Incident radiation is considered a "wave" of continuous energy
- Switch on a filament lamp, visible and infra-red waves are emitted in a continuous stream of energy (or are they?)
- The concept of the photon was first considered to help explain certain experimental results.
## Coulombmeter findings
- The white plastic charges negatively
- The clear plastic (pyrex) charges positively
## Gold-lead Electroscope
- The gold leaf and the stem of the electroscope deflect away from each other with both the white and clear plastic charging rods.
- The gold leaf repels away from the stem when they both become the same positive/negative charge.
