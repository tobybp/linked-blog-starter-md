Stable interference patterns come from sources of waves which are coherent.
Coherent means the waves have a constant phase relationship with one another. Only waves of the same frequency can be coherent.

Filament lamps produce light of different frequencies (the spectrum making up white light; they cannot produce light which is coherent).
LASER beams produce monochromatic (single-frequency) light and can produce coherent light.

## Two source interference - Young's double-slit experiment
With two coherent sources produce waves which then overlap, the resultant interference patterns are observed.

Lets consider the first bright fringe, the two waves meeting at P have to meet in phase to cause constructive interference
![[sometrianglediagram|700]]
The waves emitted from S2 has to travel one complete wavelength further than the wave from S1 to meet in phase at point P, i.e. the path difference between S1P and S2P is equal to λ.

### Young's double slit equation
λ = ax/D
λ = wavelength of waves
a = slit separation (m)
x = fringe separation (m)
D = distance between slits and screen
