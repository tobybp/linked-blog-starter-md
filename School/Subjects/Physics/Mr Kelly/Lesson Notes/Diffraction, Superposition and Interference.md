#### Diffraction
The spreading out of a wavefront as it passes through a gap or interacts with the edge of an object.
#### Superposition
When two or more wave displacements overlap they superimpose, which means that their individual vector displacements add together.
#### Constructive Interference
When two or more waves overlap in phase, they reinforce each other leading to a resulting disturbance that is larger than any of the individual disturbances
`If two equal amplitude waves meet in phase, the resulting disturbance is double the individual amplitude.`
#### Destructive interference
When two or more waves meet in antiphase, they will overlap in a manner which leads to the resulting disturbance being smaller than any of the individual disturbances.
`If two equal amplitude waves meet antiphase, the resulting disturbance is zero.`

### Explanation
As the light comes out of the laser, it is diffracted, by a filter that has holes the width of the wavelength, so that they are properly diffracted. As the light waves travel, they interfere. There will be constructive and destructive interference, this causes the variance in light levels when it hits the wall. The brighter spots are caused by constructive interference, and the dimmer ones are due to destructive interference reducing the intensity.
