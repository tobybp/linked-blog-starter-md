5) 0.17 x 4 = 0.68 
	340 / 0.68 = 500
6) C
7) 150 x 3/4 = 112.5, add 75 for every harmonic
	112.5 - 75 = 37.5, so B

13) A stationary wave, has fixed positions for its nodes, they stay still. A progressive wave, has a transfer of energy from one place to another, it does not stay still.
14) 6.8%
15) Difference: Stationary sound waves are coherent whilst progressive are incoherent.
	Similarity: both are longitudinal.
