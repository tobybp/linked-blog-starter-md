1) Express the unit of charge in base units. Show your workings using the relationship Q = It.
	Current = "A"
	Time = "s"
	Q = As
1) Express the unit of resistance in base units. Show clear workings. Hint: you will need to use the equations V = IR and V = E/Q, and the base unit for charge from Q1.
	E = joules
	E = kgm$^2$ s-$^2$ 
	V = kgm$^2$s-$^3$ 
1) Confirm whether the following equations have homogeneous units. You must show our working in each case.
	a) For changes in gravitational potential energy: ∆Ep = mg∆h
	b) Work done W = Fs (you can use the base unit equivalent of the joule from part (a))
	c) The time period, T, for a mass, m, oscillating on a spring with a force constant k:
