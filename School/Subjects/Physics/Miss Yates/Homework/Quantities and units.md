### Beyond Base Units
Although the seven base units are most commonly used to measure common quantities. There are other quantities that need to be measured.

Those are called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Derived Quantities</mark> which use <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Derived Units</mark>. Those can be worked out from the base units and equations which relate to the derived quantities.

With **derived units** any quantity can be measured.

### Names and Symbols

##### Derived Units without special names

An example of a derived unit is the unit for speed, which is m s^-1
This comes from the equation:

| Derived Quantity | Derived Unit |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| area             | m²           |
| volume           | m³           |
| acceleration     | m s⁻²        |
| density          | kg m⁻³       |


###### **Derived Units with Special Names**

Some derived quantities are used so often that they have their own special names.
**SI** has 22 derived units.


| Derived quantity              | Unit Name | Unit Symbol | Unit exressed in other units |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Force                         | Newton    | N           | kgms⁻²                       |
| Pressure                      | Pascal    | Pa          | Nm⁻²                         |
| Energy/Work Done              | Joule     | J           | Nm                           |
| Power                         | Watt      | W           | Js⁻¹                         |
| Electric potential Difference | Volt      | V           | JC⁻¹                         |
| Electric Resistance           | Ohm       | Ω           | VA⁻¹                         |
| Electric Charge               | Coulomb   | C           | As                           |
| Frequency                     | Hertz     | Hz          | s⁻¹                          |


SI Units can form many other derived units, such as newton metres: Nm

#### Temperature
The SI Base unit for temperature is the kelvin K. Although in everyday life, you are more likely to see the degrees Celsius unit. To convert from Celsius to K, you add 273.

A difference of 1 degree, is the same as the difference of 1 Kelvin.
