## Electric Mountain
The Dinorwig Power Station in north Wales is a hydroelectric power plant. It is built into Snowdonia National Park. It has two reservoirs, one 500m above the other one. Long tunnels of water pass through the mountain, carrying the water between the reservoirs. A huge cave contains six turbines. When the demand for electricity is high, the water flows down from the top reservoir, generating energy from the turbines. When little energy is required, the turbines pump water back up to the top reservoir. Dinorwig is the largest pumped storage facility in all of Europe. This method is not 100% efficient.
## Energy and Power
For high performance sports, we are interested in the rate at which energy is transferred, as well as how much energy is transferred. A powerful can has the largest value for rate of energy transfer, not just the total energy transferred.
Power is the rate of work done:
P = W/t
P is the power, W is work done, t is time.
Work done = energy transfer, power can also be the rate of energy transfer.
Power is measured in joules per second, or watts. 1W = 1 joule per second.
## Power and Motion
Sometimes constant force is exerted on an object in order to maintain a constant sped. An example of this is a car travelling on a level road at a constant speed. The net force is zero. 
A constant force F moves the car a distance (x) in a time t
work done by the force W = Fx
P = W/t = Fx/t
Speed v = x/t
P = Fv
This equation is useful for manny applications when an object is travelling at a constant speed with a constant force.
## Efficiency
The total energy of a closed system remains constant/ Although this doesn't mean that machines convert all energy into useful work. Thermal losses can mean that some input energy is not converted into useful output energy.
efficiency = (useful output energy / total input energy) x 100
The better (greater) the efficiency, the greater the percentage f input energy converted.

# Summary Questions
1) 240 / 30 = 8W
2) 120kW
3) 60 x 0.05 = 3 x 60 x 60 = 10800J
4) F = ma F = 1200 x (18/20) = 1080J
5) Power = force x velocity, (210000 x 4) x 250 = 210,000,000W = 210MW
6) work done = force x height
	work done = 15 x 1.4 = 21J
	power = work done / time
	power = 21/30 = 0.7W
	efficiency = 0.7/3.5 x 100 = 20% efficiency
7) 600MW -> 600 x 10$^6$W
	gravitational potential = (600 x 10$^6$) / 0.4(efficiency) = 1500 x 10$^6$W
	mass flow rate = Pg / gh
	= (1.5 x 10$^9$) / (9.81 x 50)
	= 3.06 x 10$^6$ kg/s
	/1000 to convert to volume flow rate
	= 3,060 m$^3$/s
