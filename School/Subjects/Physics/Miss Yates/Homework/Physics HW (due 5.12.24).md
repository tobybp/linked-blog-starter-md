2) A vehicle of mass 450kg accelerates from rest to a velocity of 9.5m/s in 38s
	Calculate:
	a) The acceleration of the vehicle
		a = (v-u) / t
		a = (9.5 - 0) / 38
		a = 0.25
	b) The motive force of the vehicle engine
		F = m x a
		F = 450 x 0.25
		F = 112.5N
	c) The ratio of the motive force to the vehicle's weight
		W = m x g
		W = 450 x 9.81
		W = 4414.5N
		F/W
		112.5 / 4414.5
		= 0.0255
3) A bullet of mass 2.4 x 10$^{-3}$ kg moving at a speed of 115m/s hits a tree and embeds itself in the tree to a depth of 85mm.
	Calculate:
	a) The impact time
		(115)$^2$ + 2a(0.085)
		0 = 13225 + 0.17a
		a = -77823.53m/s$^2$
		0 = 115 + (-77823.53)t
		t = 115 / -77823.53
		t = 0.00148
	b) The deceleration of the bullet in the tree
		a = -77823.53m/s$^2$ 
	c) the impact force on the bullet
		F = m x a
		F = 2.4 x 10$^{-3}$ kg x (-77823.53)m/s$^2$
		F = -186.8N
4) A heavy goods vehicle of total weight 320kN has an engine which has a maximum motive force of 6kN
	a) Calculate:
	i) The mass of the vehicle
		W = m x g
		m = 320000N / 9.81
		m = 32619.16kg
	ii) The maximum acceleration of the vehicle
		a = F/m
		a = 6000/32619.16
		a = 0.184m/s$^2$
	iii) The time taken for the vehicle to accelerate from rest to a speed of 20m/s
		t = (v - u) / a
		t = 20 - 0 / 0.184
		t = 108.7 seconds
	iv) The distance moved by the vehicle in this time
		d = 0 + 1/2(0.184)(108.7)$^2$
	b) The vehicle pulls a trailer of weight 60kN
	i) Calculate the maximum acceleration of the vehicle with the trailer attached.
		320000/9.81
		vehicle = 32619.16
		60000/9.81
		trailer = 6110.6
		total mass = 38729.76
		net force = 6000-5000 = 1000N
		a = F/m
		a = 1000/38729.76
		a = 0.0258m/s$^2$
	ii) The trailer and the vehicle are connected by a horizontal tow bar. Resistive forces (friction and air resistance) cause a total backwards force of 5kN, acting on the trailer. Calculate the tension on the tow-bar (draw a free body diagram of the trailer first)
		Ftrailer = 6110.6 x 0.0258m/s$^2$
		Ftrailer = 157.65
		T = 157.65 + 5000
		T = 5157.65N
