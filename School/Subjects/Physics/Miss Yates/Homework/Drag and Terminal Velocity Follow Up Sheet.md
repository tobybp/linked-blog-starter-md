1a) By placing 10cm markers along the tube, they can use a stopwatch and note the cumulative time elapsed since dropping, every time the ball bearing sinks through one of these rings of tape (markers). They can then work out the average speed between each loop of tape, by taking away the time from the current tape, by the one prior to it. This would give the time taken to get from the previous tape to the current one, then use the distance of 10cm and the equation speed = distance / time, to work out the speed. Then using these results for velocity, you can plot a velocity time graph.
1b) They would need to measure the distance with a ruler with an uncertainty of 1mm
	They would also need to measure the time taken using a stopwatch that has an uncertainty of 0.01 seconds
1c) The largest error could be human error, or a systematic parallax error. Human errors could be things like dropping the ball and starting stopwatch at the same time not being done perfectly. These errors can be mitigated or minimised by taking multiple results readings, then finding the mean of the results.

3) Following newtons first law, the object falls due to an external force acting on it. In this case the force is gravity. According to newtons second law all objects have a terminal velocity due to F = m x a. When an object falls it follows the equation in that its force acting down is its mass, multiplied by its acceleration. But when the object falls, the drag force will increase, so after a while, the drag force will be equal to the downwards gravitational force from F = ma. So the net force will become 0, meaning it is not speeding up or slowing down, and is therefore falling at a constant velocity.
4) David's experiment will agree with Galileo because there is virtually no air resistance when you are on the moon. Also, Newton's second law means that acceleration = F / m. Acceleration = mg/m, this will equal a = g, so mass is negligible, therefore mass has no effect on the acceleration.
