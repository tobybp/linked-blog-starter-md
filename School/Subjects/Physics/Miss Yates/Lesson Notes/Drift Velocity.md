##### The velocity at which electrons flow/drift through a wire.

We can say that current, "I" is directly proportional to:
Cross-sectional area, "+"
Number of free electrons per volume, n
Electric charge, e
Drift velocity, v
### I = Anev    
Drift velocity equation

#### Worked Example:
A wire with a diameter of 2mm, and an electron density of $5$ x $10^{28}$ carries a current of 1.5A.
Calculate the drift velocity of the electrons.

#### v = I / neA
I = 1.5A
n = $5$ x $10^{28}$ 
A = ?
e = $1.6$  $10^{-19}$C

A = πr$^2$ 
\= π(d/2)$^2$ 
\= π((2x$10^{-3}$ $/$ 2))$^2$ 
\= 3.14 x 10$^-6$ m$^2$
