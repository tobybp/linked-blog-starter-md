At first, the ball exponentially increases its velocity towards the ground. When the ball meets the ground. Then It quickly rises, at a slowing velocity, until it stops mid air, then starts to accelerate towards the ground again. The peaks of the graph get lower and lower each bounce as the netball loses its overall energy due to it dissipating to the surroundings via sound and heat. The bounces also happen more frequently, as the netball takes less time to bounce due to not bouncing as high.
