Tensile stress - The tensile force applied per unit cross-sectional area
A wire has a cross-sectional area of 0.25mm^2. A mass of 1kg is hung from it
	What is the tension in the wire?
		Tension = mg = 9.81 x 1 = 9.81
	What is the stress in the wire?
		= F/A = 9.81 / 0.00000025 = 39,240,000Pa
## Tensile Strain
Tensile strain - The ratio of extension to the original length of the object
Tensile strain (dimensionless) - Extension (m) / original length (m)
#### A wire has a cross-sectional area of 0.25mm. A mass of 1kg is hung from it. It has an initial length of 2.0m and extends by 1.5mm
a) what is x for this wire
	0.00000025
b) What is the strain in the wire
	7.4 x 10$^{-4}$
c) What is the stress
	3.9 x 10$^7$
d) What is the stress/strain? and what are the units
	3.9 x 10$^7$ / 7.4 x 10$^{-4}$ = 5.2 x 10$^{10}$w
## Young Modulus
Ratio of tensile stress and tensile strain
Young modulus (Pa) = Stress (Pa) / Strain
The Young modulus is the measure of stiffness of a material - how hard it is to stretch, bend or compress. It is a property of the material - same value should be measured for any size or shape sample tested.

| Yield Point               | Point on a stress-strain graph beyond which the deformation is no longer entirely elastic                              |
| Ultimate tensile strength | The maximum stress that an object can withstand before fracture occurs                                                 |
| Breaking strength         | Stress value at the point of fracture                                                                                  |
| Ductile                   | Materials that can undergo large extensions without reaching breaking stress- e.g. copper can be stretched into wires. |
| Brittle                   | Material shows little strain before reaching breaking stress                                                           |
