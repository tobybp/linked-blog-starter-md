#### Objectives:
- Resolve vectors into two perpendicular components
- Combine non-perpendicular vectors using 3 methods

## Resolving Vectors
We can resolve a vector into two perpendicular components, which together have the **same effect** as the original vector and act from the **same place.**

### Method 1: Use scale drawings:

### Example:

### Method 2: Use cosine and sine rules
- Draw a sketch first
- Calculate F using cosine rule
	- (a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A)
- Calculate using sine rule

### Method 3: Using vector resolution
- Draw a sketch
- Resolve all vectors into suitable perpendicular components
- Add the horizontal components
- Add the vertical components
- Find the resultant vector
