`Spec: 3.2.4`
`Textbook: P65-69`
#### Objectives:
To be able to:
- Define and calculate density
- Define and calculate pressure
- Calculate uncertainty in practical measurement of density
- Relate idea of pressure to design of products
### Why does a sharp knife cut better than a blunt one?
A sharp knife cuts better than a blunt knife because it has a very thing edge. The force you apply is concentrated into a very small area. We say the pressure under the blade is large (because pressure = force exerted perpendicular to a surface per unit area).
### Definitions:
 Pressure = force exerted perpendicular to a surface per unit area
 Units are Pa (pascals). 1 Pa = 1Nm$^{-2}$ 
 Pressure, p = F/a
 The density of a substance is its mass per unit volume.
 Density, ρ = m/v
 SI unit: kg m$^{-3}$  (kg/m$^{3}$)
### Measuring Density - Practical
`Aim: to calculate the density of the substances provided using 2 methods.`
`Calculate the uncertainty in your value of density by each method.`
Resolution: 0.02mm (we can measure 7.62mm, 7.64mm, 7.66mm)
Uncertainty: : = 7.62 +- 0.02mm or 7.62 x 10 $^{-3}$ +- 2 x  10 $^{-5}$ m
### Measurements:
##### Long silver one:
width = 20mm +- 0.02mm
(square end)
length = 100.5mm +- 0.02mm
volume = 40,200 mm$^3$ +- 0.06mm
percentage uncertainty = 0.000149% (3sf)
mass = 109g +- 1g ( 0.109g)

##### Small Brass one:
width = 20.1mm +- 0.02mm
(square end)
length = 50.2mm +- 0.02mm
volume = 20,281.302 mm$^3$ +- 0.06mm
percentage uncertainty = 0.000296% (3sf)
mass = 171g +- 1g
##### Big darker one
width = 40mm +- 0.02mm
depth = 30mm +- 0.02mm
height = 50.2mm +- 0.02mm
volume = 60240 mm$^3$ +-0.06mm
percentage uncertainty = 0.0000996%
mass = 474g +- 1g

### Pressure in Fluids
Fluids exert an equal pressure in all directions on surfaces due to movement of their molecules (or atoms).
In a liquid, the pressure depends on:
- Depth
- Density of fluid -> temperature
- g
### P = ρgh
h = height
g = 9.81Nkg$^{-1}$
ρ = density
