Expression for horizontal displacement at time `t` is $s = ut$
Expression for vertical displacement at time `t` is $s = ut + 1/2 at`^2$

A projectile is any object that is acted upon by only gravity.

The vertical component of velocity **changes over time**. Its **vertical acceleration equals g, acting downwards**.
The **horizontal velocity** component of the object is **constant** (no horizontal forces).
The motions in the **horizontal** and **vertical direction**s are **independent** of each other.
The path of a projectile is always a parabola.

### Example
A ball is kicked horizontally at 7m/s from a cliff 80m high. How far from the base of the cliff does it land?

Method for projectile motion problems:
1. Draw a diagram
2. Treat horizontal and vertical motion **separately** - work out a strategy to solve the problem.
3. Solve each step.

#### Questions:
1a) Trying to find v
v = u$^2$ + 2as
s = 50
u = 4.0
v = ?
a = 9.8m/s
t = ?

v$^2$ = 4.0$^2$ + 2 x (9.8)(50) 
v$^2$ = 996
v = 31.56

1b)  s = ut + at$^2$
50 = ut + 9.81 x t$^2$
9.81 x t$^2$ - 4t - 50 = 0
t = 2.06

1c) 50
-4 x 2.8
38.8m

2a) S = 45
u = 0
v = ?
a = 9/8
t = ?

### Example:
A ball is kicked with an initial velocity of 15m/s at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal, calculate the range R of the ball.

1) Draw a diagram:

2) Steps to solve: Work out flight time - vertical component "landing" equals vertical component on launch. Then calculate range.
3) Vertical motion: s = u = 15sin(30) = 7.5m/s v = -7.5m/s a = -9.81
v = u + at
t = (v - u) / a
= -15 / -9.81 
= 1.53s
s = ut
So range, R = 15cos(30) x 1.53 = 20m
