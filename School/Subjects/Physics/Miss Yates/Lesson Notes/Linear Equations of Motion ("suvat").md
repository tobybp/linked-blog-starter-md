 1. A stone i dropped from a distance of 1.6m. At what velocity does it hit the ground? (g=9.81)
 nvm...

Extra suvat questions:
1. a particle is accelerated uniformly from the rest, so that after 1- seconds it has achieved a speed of 15 m/s. Find its acceleration and the distance it has covered.
	s = ?
	u = 0
	v = 15 ms$^{-1}$
	a = 2
	t = 10s
	 ---
	 15 ms = 0 + a(10)
	 a = 1.5
	 ---
	 s = 1/2 x (u + v)t
	 s = 1/2 x (0 + 15) x 10
	 s = 75
	 ---
2.    A car accelerates uniformly from rest and after 12 seconds has covered 40m. What are its acceleration and its final velocity.
	 s = 40
	 u = 0
	 v = ?
	 a = ?
	 t = 12
	 40 = 0 + 1/2 x (a) x 144
	 a = 0.55 $ms^{-2}$ 
	 ---
	 v = 0 + (0.56 x 12)
	 v = 6.67
	 ---
3) A train is uniformly retarded from 35m/s to 21m/s over a distance of 350m. Calculate the retardation and the time taken to come to rest from the 35m/s
	 s = 350
	 u = 35
	 v = 21
	 a = ?
	 t = ?
	 ---
	 s = 1/2 x (u + v) x t
	 s = 1/2 x (35 + v) x t
	 350 = 1/2 x (35 + 21) x t
	 t = 12.5
	 ---
	v = u + at
	35 = 21 + 12.5 x a
	12.5 / 14
	a = -1.12
	---
4) A particle is accelerated from 1m/s to 5m/s over a distance of 15m. Find the acceleration and the time taken.
	s = 15
	u = 1
	v = 5
	a = ?
	t = ?
	---
	15 = 1/2 x 6 x t
	15 = 3 x t
	t = 5s
	---
	5 = 1 + a5
	4 / 5 = a
	a = 0.8ms$^{-2}$ 
	---
5) A car accelerates uniformly from 5m/s to 15m/s taking 7.5 seconds. How far did it travel during this period.
	10 x 7.5 = 75m
6) A particle moves with uniform acceleration of 0.5m/s$^2$ in a horizontal line ABC. The speed of the particle C is 80m/s and the time taken from A to B and from B to C are 40 and 30 seconds respectively. Calculate:
	a) Speed at A
	s = 
	u = 80m/s
	v = 
	a = 0.5m/s
	t = 
	
	b) Distance BC
