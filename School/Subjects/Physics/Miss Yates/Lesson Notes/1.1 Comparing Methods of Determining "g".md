| 0.38     | 13.8         |
| 0.66     | 4.59         |
| 0.45     | 9.88         |
| 0.56     | 6.38         |
| 0.44     | 8.33         |
| 0.59     | 5.75         |
| 0.46     | 9.45         |
| 0.45     | 9.88         |
| 0.54     | 6.86         |
| 0.60     | 5.55         |
Average = 8.047 m/s$^2$

## Method B
Acceleration from A to B

| u    | v    | t     | a          |

#### Equation to use:
$v = u + at$
$a = (v - u) / t$

Sum of all accelerations: $85.12827893$
average acceleration: 8.51 m/s$^2$ 

## Method C
Acceleration at A

| Acceleration (m/s)                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8.85                                                   |

| 8.59                                                   |
| 9.84                                                   |
Sum of all: 93.46
Average acceleration = 9.346 m/s
## Questions:
2.  i) Using the same person to record the time on the stopwatch.
	ii) By using the same stopwatch each time.
	iii) The air resistance would likely slow down the ball more, therefore providing a reading that is slower than it would be without air resistance.
3. They are somewhat lower than the value for earth's gravity. This is likely due to air resistance.
4. The singular light gate, provided the most accurate result compared to 9..81. 
	4.7% discrepancy.
5. Method C, with the singular light gate.
6. Because it uses the time
7. Yes, because it is being used as the initial velocity within the SUVAT equations.
