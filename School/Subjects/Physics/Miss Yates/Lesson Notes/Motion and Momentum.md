| F=ma                    | P - (F + N2) = ma      | N3 - F = ma |

| P - (F + 2ma + 2F) = ma | N2 - (ma + F + F) = ma | N3 = ma + F |
| P = 3(ma + F)           | N2 = 2ma + 2F          |             |

linear momentum = product of an object's mass and linear velocity


Principle of conservation of momentum = In a closed system the total momentum in any direction remains constant

runners:
momentum before = (90 x 5) + (70 x -2) = 310kgm/s

A gun of mass 5kg resting on a smooth surface fires a bullet of mass 50g at a speed of 500m/s. Calculate the speed and direction of motion of the gun.
Before: 
	momentum = mv = 5.05 x 0 = 0kgm/s
bullet after firing: 
	= 0.05 x 500 = 25kgm/s
gun after firing:
	25 + gun momentum = 0kgm/s
	momentum of gun = -25kgm/s
velocity of gun:
	v = momentum / mass = -25 / 5 = -5m/s
