| F=ma                    | P - (F + N2) = ma      | N3 - F = ma |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| P - (F + 2ma + 2F) = ma | N2 - (ma + F + F) = ma | N3 = ma + F |
| P = 3(ma + F)           | N2 = 2ma + 2F          |             |

linear momentum = product of an object's mass and linear velocity


Principle of conservation of momentum = In a closed system the total momentum in any direction remains constant

runners:
momentum before = (90 x 5) + (70 x -2) = 310kgm/s

A gun of mass 5kg resting on a smooth surface fires a bullet of mass 50g at a speed of 500m/s. Calculate the speed and direction of motion of the gun.
Before: m = 5.05kg
