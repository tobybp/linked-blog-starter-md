linear momentum = product of an object's mass and linear velocity


Principle of conservation of momentum = In a closed system the total momentum in any direction remains constant

runners:
momentum before = (90 x 5) + (70 x -2) = 310kgm/s

A gun of mass 5kg resting on a smooth surface fires a bullet of mass 50g at a speed of 500m/s. Calculate the speed and direction of motion of the gun.
Before: 
	momentum = mv = 5.05 x 0 = 0kgm/s
bullet after firing: 
	= 0.05 x 500 = 25kgm/s
gun after firing:
	25 + gun momentum = 0kgm/s
	momentum of gun = -25kgm/s
velocity of gun:
	v = momentum / mass = -25 / 5 = -5m/s
1) B
2) A
3) C
4) An object stays at rest / at a constant velocity until it is acted upon by a resultant force
5) The velocity of the person is towards the left, the momentum of the person is equal to the momentum of the ball. Total momentum is zero at the start. Speed of person < speed of ball.
6) Because the type of forces are not the same. The clothes are acting down with gravitational potential energy. Both forces are acting on the same object. They should be acting on different.
7) Have the same magnitude, same type of force, act in different directions, act on different bodies.

Principle of conservation of momentum:
	In a closed system

### Dropping balls:
Momentum was not conserved because external forces were acting, such as drag.
Total energy was conserved (law of conservation of energy).
Degree to which kinetic energy was conserved:

### Billiard balls:
- The temperature of the balls increases
- Not really possible due to not being in a closed environment

## Kinetic Energy = 1/2mv^2

Beach ball question:
	momentum before = (5x2) + (-7 x 3) = -11kgm/s
	momentum after = -11kgm/s = (-8 x 2) + (v x 3)
	v = (-11 + 16) / 3 = 1.7m/s
b) 
	KE before: (1/2 x 2 x 5^2) + (1/2 x 3 x -7^2) = 98.5J
	KE after: (1/2 x 2 x -8^2) + (1/2 x 3 x 1.7^2) = 68.2J
