The total distance travelled from when the driver first sees a reason to stop, to when the vehicle stops.
Stopping distance equals thinking distance + braking distance
S = ut
S is directly proportional to t
### Thinking Distance:
The distance travelled between the moment when you first see a reason to stop to the moment when the brakes are applied.
### Braking Distance:
The distance travelled from the time the brakes are applied until the vehicle stops.
### Factors 
- Alcohol consumption
- Drug use
- Tiredness
- Speed
### Summary Questions
1) 1.5 x 22 = 33m thinking distance + 38 = 71 meters
2) As the speed of the car doubles, so does the thinking distance.
