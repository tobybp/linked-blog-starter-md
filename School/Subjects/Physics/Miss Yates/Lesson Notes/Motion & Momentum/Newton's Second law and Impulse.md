## Airbags
How does an airbag increase driver safety?
- Reduces force
- Increases time of collision
- Change in momentum is the same as without airbag
## Newton's 2nd Law
Definition: `The net (resultant) force acting on an object is directly proportional to the rate ofo change of its momentum, and is in the same direction.`
(F = ma is a special case of Newton's 2nd law, applicable where the mass of the body is constant):
F = ∆p / ∆t = (mv - mu) / t = m((v - u) / t) = ma
### Example
What is the net force on a dummy of 4.5kg travelling at 15m/s in a test crash, it comes to a stop in 2.3s?
1) Select equation, F = ∆p / ∆t
2) Determine change in momentum: ∆p = m(v-u) = 4..5(0 - 15) = -67.5kgm/s
3) Substitute values in to find F: F = ∆p / ∆t = -67.5/2.3 = -29.3N
## Practice Questions
1) A car takes 4.2s to come to a stop with a change of momentum of $5.1$ x $10^4$ kgm/s. What is the net force acting on the car?
	F = ∆p / ∆t
	F = $5.1$ x $10^4$ / 4.2
	F = 12142.85714
2) A force of 320N acts on a ball for 1.5s calculate the change in momentum
	320 = ∆p / 1.5
	320 x 1.5 = 480kgm/s
3) A steam train is burning coal and travelling at 5m/s after 500s its mass has a decreased from 4100kg to 3800kg, calculate the force acting on the train.
	F = ∆p / ∆t
	F = (4100 - 3800) / 500
	F = 3N
4) A tennis ball is in contact with a wall for 2ms, it has a mass of 60g and initial velocity of 14m/s, calculate the force on the ball
	F = ∆p / ∆t = 60 x 10^-3 x 14 / (2 x 10^-3)
	F = 420N
## Tennis Serve
How does the force applied by the racket to the ball change over time?

## Impulse
Forces causing acceleration are not always constant. To analyse these, we need to use the idea of the impulse of a force.
##### Definition: The impulse of a force is the product of the force and the time for which the force is applied (impulse = F x ∆t)
#### Impulse = Change in momentum
- Impulse has units Ns or kgm/s (it must have same units as momentum)
- Impulse is equal to the area under the curve on a force-time graph
### Example:
A force is applied to a toy car with a mass 0.5kg. The force varies as shown.
##### Calculate:
1) Impulse of the force
	4 + 8 + 8 = 20kgm/s
2) The final velocity of the toy car
	p = mv
	20 = 0.5 x v
	v = 40m/s

## Exam Questions
1) (10 x 45)/2 + 70 x 45 + (20 x 45)/2 = 3825kgm/s / 1000 -> seconds = 3.825kgm/s
	= B
2) (0.058 x 7.2) - (0.058 x -3.6) =  0.63kgm/s
	F = 0.63 / 0.052 / F = 0.058 x 2-8 = 12.05 = 12N
3) a) 0.16 x 20 = 3.2
	b) 3.2 / 0.033 = 98
4) a) kinetic energy is conserved
	b) 0.16 x 20 = (m+16) x 8 + 0.16 x -12
	(m + 0.16) x 8 = 5.12
	m = 0.48
5) 0.5 x 0.4 x 18  = 3.6
	3.6 / 0.045 = 80m/s
6) The time taken for the driver to stop is more or distance travelled by the driver is greater 
	F = ma
	a decreases...
