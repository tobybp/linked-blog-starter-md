Total momentum before = 1200 x 2 + 1000 x -2 = 2400 - 2000 = 400
Total momentum after = 1200 x 1 + 100 x v = 1200 + 100x?
1200 + 1000 x v = 400
v = -0.8 m/s

`Since linear momentum is conserved in all directions, the sum of the momentum vectors after the collision is equal to the momentum vector before the collision. We can represent this using a vector triangle.`



1) Sketch the vector triangle
	![[Excalidraw/vectortriangle.md]]
2) Calculate p (before):
	p = mv 0.2 x 8 = 1.6kgm/s
3) Calculate magnitude of p1:
	p1 = mv = 0.2 x 3 = 0.6 kgm/s
4) Use Pythagoras' theorem to solve for p2 and the speed of ball B:
	sqrt(1.6$^2$ - 0.6$^2$) = 1.5
	1.5 / 0.2 = 7.5
