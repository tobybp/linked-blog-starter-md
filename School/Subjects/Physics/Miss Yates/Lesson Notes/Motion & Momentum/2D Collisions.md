Total momentum before = 1200 x 2 + 1000 x -2 = 2400 - 2000 = 400
Total momentum after = 1200 x 1 + 100 x v = 1200 + 100x?
1200 + 1000 x v = 400
v = -0.8 m/s

`Since linear momentum is conserved in all directions, the sum of the momentum vectors after the collision is equal to the momentum vector before the collision. We can represent this using a vector triangle.`
