## Airbags
How does an airbag increase driver safety?
- Reduces force
- Increases time of collision
- Change in momentum is the same as without airbag
## Newton's 2nd Law
Definition: `The net (resultant) force acting on an object is directly proportional to the rate ofo change of its momentum, and is in the same direction.`
(F = ma is a special case of Newton's 2nd law, applicable where the mass of the body is constant):
F = ∆p / ∆t = (mv - mu) / t = m((v - u) / t) = ma
