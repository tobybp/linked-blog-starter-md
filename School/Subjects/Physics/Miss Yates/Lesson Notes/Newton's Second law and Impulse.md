## Airbags
How does an airbag increase driver safety?
- Reduces force
- Increases time of collision
- Change in momentum is the same as without airbag
## Newton's 2nd Law
Definition: `The net (resultant) force acting on an object is directly proportional to the rate ofo change of its momentum, and is in the same direction.`
(F = ma is a special case of Newton's 2nd law, applicable where the mass of the body is constant):
F = ∆p / ∆t = (mv - mu) / t = m((v - u) / t) = ma
### Example
What is the net force on a dummy of 4.5kg travelling at 15m/s in a test crash, it comes to a stop in 2.3s?
1) Select equation, F = ∆p / ∆t
2) Determine change in momentum: ∆p = m(v-u) = 4..5(0 - 15) = -67.5kgm/s
3) Substitute values in to find F: F = ∆p / ∆t = -67.5/2.3 = -29.3N
## Practice Questions
1) A car takes 4.2s to come to a stop with a change of momentum of $5.1$ x $10^4$ kgm/s. What is the net force acting on the car?
	F = ∆p / ∆t
