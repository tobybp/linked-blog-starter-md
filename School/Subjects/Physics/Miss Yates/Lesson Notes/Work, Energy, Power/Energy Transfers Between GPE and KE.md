### Asteroid Example
M = 1.2 x 10$^7$
V = 19km$^{-1}$ -> 19 x 10$^3$ ms$^{-1}$
KE = ?
1/2mv$^2$
1/2 x 1.2 x 10$^7$ x (19 x 10$^3$)$^2$ = 2.2 x 10$^{15}$J

E = 1/2 mv$^2$
Ek = kinetic energy, J
m = mass, kg
v = speed, m/s

Gravitational potential energy is the energy associated with an object as a result of its position in a gravitational field. In a uniform gravitational field:
Ep = mgh (note: this equals work done against the weight of the object)


### 1)
Mass = 60kg
Angle of 30 degrees
Ignore resistance forces
What speed is the sledge moving after it has travelled 25m?
W = 60 x 9.81 = 588.6N 
(x = 588.6 x sin30) = f (in f = ma)
f = ma
294.3 = 60 x a
a = 294.3/60
a = 4.905
v$^2$ = u$^2$ + 2as
v = sqrt(2as)
v = sqrt(2x4.9x25)
v = 15.67 m/s
#### OR
Ep = mgh
60 x 9.81 x 25sin30
=7357.5
=1/2mv$^2$
v = sqrt(2ep / 60)
v = sqrt((2 x 7357.5) / 60)
v = 15.66

### 2)
W = 50 x 25 = 1250
7357.5 - 1250 = 6,107.5
= 14.27m/s

QUESTIONS
1 Calculate the work done when:
a) a weight of 40 N is raised by a height of 5.0 m, 
b) a spring is stretched to an extension of 0.45 m by a
force of 20 N.
2 Calculate the energy transferred by a force of 12 N when it moves an object by a distance of 4.0 m: a in the direction of the force.
b in a direction at 60Â° to the direction of the force, e in a direction at right angles to the direction of the
force.
3 A luggage trolley of total weight 400 N is pushed at a Steady speed 20 m up a slope by a force of 50 N acting
in the same direction as the object moves in. At the end of this distance, the trolley is 1.5 m higher than at the start. Calculate,
a the work done pushing the trolley up the slope, b the gain of potential energy of the trolley, c the energy wasted due to friction.
4 A spring that obeys Hooke's Law requires a force of
1.2 N to extend it to an extension of 50 mm.
Calculate:
a the force needed to extend it to an extension of
100 mm.
b the work done when the spring is stretched to an
extension of 100 mm.
