`The extension of the spring is directly proportional to the applied force, unless the limit of proportionality is exceeded.`
### In series:
1/k`total` = 1/k`1` + 1/k`2` + 1/k`n`
### In parallel
k`total` = k`1` + k`2` + k`n`

A force of 8N causes a 250mm spring to increase in length to 300mm
i) calculate the force constant of the spring
	F = kx
	k = F/x
	x = 300 - 250 = 50
	k = 8 / 0,05
	k = 160
ii) 3 of the same type of springs connected in parallel. Find the extension now and the effective force constant of the springs
	F/3 = kx
	x = F/3k = 8/(3x160) = 0.017
	k = F/x = 8/0.017 = 470.6 Nm$^{-1}$ = Effective spring constant.
iii) Instead of the springs are connected in series. Find the total extension and the effective force constant.
	k = F/x 
	k = 8/(3x50x10$^{-3}$) = 53.3Nm$^{-1}$
	force is the same in each spring, total extension = 3x
