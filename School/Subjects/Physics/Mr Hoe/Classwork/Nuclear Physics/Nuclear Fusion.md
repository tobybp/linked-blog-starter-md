Products might have an increased BE/nucleus, if so, energy is released
ΔE = Δmc$^2$
**IF** there is a loss of mass during the process, energy is released
#### Nuclear fusion
- The joining of two small nuclei to form one larger nucleus
- Overcoming electrostatic repulsion (coulomb barrier)
- Must get close, so strong force can act
- Spontaneous? no
- Conditions? star-like
#### Advantages of fusion over fission? Disadvantages...
- Energy density
- Less (no) radioactive waste
- Resources
