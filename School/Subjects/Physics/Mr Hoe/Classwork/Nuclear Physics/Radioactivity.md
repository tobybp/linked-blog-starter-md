More sides, more throws needed, and "less steep" decay.
y = ae$^{-bx}$ (exponential decay)
a = constant, relates to maximum value before decay
b = constant, relates to "steepness" or "shape"

A = -λN
A = A₀e$^{-λt}$ 
`bringing half life in...`
A₀ = Initial activity
t = t1/2 (half life)
at t1/2 the activity will be A₀/2
A₀/2 = A₀e$^{-λ(t1/2)}$
ln(A₀/2) = A₀(-λ\*t1/2)
**ln2 / t(1/2) = λ**
