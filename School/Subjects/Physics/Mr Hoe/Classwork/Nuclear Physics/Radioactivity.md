More sides, more throws needed, and "less steep" decay.
y = ae$^{-bx}$ (exponential decay)
a = constant, relates to maximum value before decay
b = constant, relates to "steepness" or "shape"

A = -λN
A = A₀e$^{-λt}$ 
`bringing half life in...`
A₀ = Initial activity
t = t1/2 (half life)
at t1/2 the activity will be A₀/2
A₀/2 = A₀e$^{-λ(t1/2)}$
ln(A₀/2) = A₀(-λ\*t1/2)
**ln2 / t(1/2) = λ**

We have a sample with 22g of C₁₄
Half life of C₁₄ is 5730yrs
Initial activity?
A = -λN

moles??
If we have 1 moles, there is 6.02 x 10$^{23}$ particles
C₁₄ -  1 mole is 14kg
mass of sample / mass of one mole = number of moles
moles x 6.02x10$^{23}$ = number of particles
moles = 22 / 14
particles = 22/14 x 6.02x10$^{23}$
λ = ln(2) / 5730x3.16x10$^7$
How many years until 7g of C₁₄ left?
- N = N₀e$^{-λt}$
- 7 = 22e$^{-λt}$
- 7/22 = e$^{-λt}$
- ln(7/22) = -λt
- t = 2.99x10$^{11}$s
- 2.99x10$^{11}$ / 60 / 60 / 24 = 9466 years
1) A = λN
2) λ = ln2 / t1/2
3) A = A₀e$^{-λt}$
4) N = N₀e$^{-λt}$
5) ln(A) = ln()
