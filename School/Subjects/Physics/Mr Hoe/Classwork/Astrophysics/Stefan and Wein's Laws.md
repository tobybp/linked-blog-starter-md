Comparing absorption and emission spectra.
Hot gas -> Prism -> Emission spectrum
	Dark background with coloured lines
Light -> cold gas -> Prism -> Absorption spectrum
	Brightly coloured background with missing wavelengths (black lines)
## Wein's Law
Black body radiation
- A 'perfect black body' radiates the best
- The way it radiates depends upon temperature
- All bodies radiate when T > 0K
- They radiate with a peak wavelength
- Hotter bodies radiate with more total intensity \*
- Hotter bodies radiate a broader spectrum
- Hotter bodies radiate peak at shorter wavelength
- Wein's Law says λ$_{max}$= a1/T  
\*power per unit area
![[Excalidraw/WeinsLaw.md]]
λ$_{max}$ is proportional to 1/T
(λ$_{max1}$)/(λ$_{max2}$) = T$_2$ / T$_1$  
Data for the sun:
Surface temperature = 5800K
Peak wavelength = 500nm

## Stefan's law
The luminosity of an object is proportional to the absolute temperature of an object to the power of four
L is proportional to T$^4$
Where:
L = Luminosity / W
T = Absolute temperature / K
L$_1$ / L$_2$ = T$_1$$^4$ / T$_2$$^4$ 

L = 4πr$^2$σT$^4$
Where:
	L = luminosity\* of star / W
	r = radius of star / m
	σ = Stefan-Boltzman constant
	T = surface temperature of star / K
	\* Luminosity is the total energy emitted per unit time
