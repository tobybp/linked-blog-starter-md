Comparing absorption and emission spectra.
Hot gas -> Prism -> Emission spectrum
	Dark background with coloured lines
Light -> cold gas -> Prism -> Absorption spectrum
	Brightly coloured background with missing wavelengths (black lines)
## Wein's Law
Black body radiation
- A 'perfect black body' radiates the best
- The way it radiates depends upon tmperature
- All bodies radiate when T > 0K
- They radiate with a peak wavelength
- Hotter bodies radiate with more total intensity
- Hotter bodies radiate a broader spectrum
- Hotter bodies radiate peak at shorter watelength
