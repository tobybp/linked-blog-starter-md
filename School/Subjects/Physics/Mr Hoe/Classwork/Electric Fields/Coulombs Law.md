#### F = 1/4πε₀Qq/r$^2$
#### F = (1 / 4πε₀) x (Qq / r$^2$)
Where:
F = force/N
Q and q = charge on object each object/C
ε₀ = permittivity of free space / Fm$^{-1}$
r = separation (from centres) / m
Directly proportional to the product of the charges.
## Permittivity of free space
- Ability of free space to carry an electric field
- Sometimes called "the electric constant"
- Technically this is "in a vacuum"
- Being in air, the value is not significantly different
- In other materials, it is!
- This will be important to consider for "capacitors", something for another day
- SI unit is Fm$^{-1}$ `Farads per m`
