## What is a field?
- A region of space
- Where you can experience a force
- If you have the right property
- Electric -> charge
- Gravitational -> mass
- Magnetic -> magnetic properties
- All forces are derived from these fields
- Except for the strong force
- Oh, and also the weak interaction (weak force)?
## Investigating Charge (rods)
- What did you do?
	Rub rods with cloth
- What did you observe?
	repulsion (same), attraction (opposite)
	2 observations, therefore at least 2 types of charge
 - What is happening?
	Electrons transfer, lose electrons = +ve, gain electrons = -ve
- Why?
### Investigating Charge (balloon)
"We always think **positively**"
### As a reminder...
- There is an invisible stuff called **charge**
- There is (at least) **two types** of charge
- We already know **protons** are **positive**
- We already know **electrons** are **negative**
- We can **charge through friction**
- This **causes electrons to move**
- **Gaining** electrons -> becoming **negative**
- **Losing** electrons -> becoming **positive**
## Electric Field around a Point Charge
- Evenly spread out angles
- Closer together lines means a stronger field (more field strength)
- Outward direction
- Symmetrical
- Radial
- Field lines perpendicular to surface
- Uniform angular spacing
## What is an electric field?
### ==Definition: a region of space where a charged object experiences a force
	E = F/Q
- Produced by a charged object
- Invisible field lines
- Direction -> effect on positive charge

## Bouncing Sphere
Insulated sphere of aluminium foil, Positive plate on the left, negative on the right. Pushes to the left, gets repelled. Hits the plate on the right and gains electrons, becomes negatively charged and is attracted to the left, and repelled from the right. Hits the plate on the left and vice versa.
