## What is a field?
- A region of space
- Where you can experience a force
- If you have the right property
- Electric -> charge
- Gravitational -> mass
- Magnetic -> magnetic properties
- All forces are derived from these fields
- Except for the strong force
- Oh, and also the weak interaction (weak force)?
## Investigating Charge (rods)
- What did you do?
	Rub rods with cloth
- What did you observe?
	repulsion (same), attraction (opposite)
	2 observations, therefore at least 2 types of charge
 - What is happening?
	Electrons transfer, lose electrons = +ve, gain electrons = -ve
- Why?
