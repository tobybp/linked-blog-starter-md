## What is a field?
- A region of space
- Where you can experience a force
- If you have the right property
- Electric -> ;charge
- Gravitational -> mass
- Magnetic -> magnetic properties
- All forces are derived from these fields
- Except for the strong force
- Oh, and also the weak interaction (weak force)?
