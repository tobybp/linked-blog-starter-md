A magnetic field is a region of space around a magnet, where magnetic materials experience a force.
Magnetic fields are either permanent, due to a magnetised chunk of magnetic material, or due to current carrying conductors.
- Flux = the field lines
- Flux symbol = Φ
- Flux unit = webber (Wb)
- Flux density (magnetic field strength) = magnetic flux per unit area
- Flux density symbol = B
- Flux density unit = tesla (T) or webber per unit area (Wbm$^{-2}$)
## Φ / A = B
