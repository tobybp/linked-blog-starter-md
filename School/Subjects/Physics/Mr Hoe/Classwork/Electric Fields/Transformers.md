About 4v a.c.
A small ac emf is induced ≈ mV
The varying B from coil one "links" and induces emf
Varying I leading to a varying e-mag field (B)

## Lesson 2:

Power in = Power out if ==100% efficient==
**I***in***V***in* = **I***out* / **I***in*
Ratio of the p.ds is inverse the ratio of the currents.
