About 4v a.c.
A small ac e.m.f. is induced ≈ mV
The varying B from coil one "links" and induces e.m.f.
Varying I leading to a varying e-mag field (B)

## Lesson 2:

Power in = Power out if ==100% efficient==
**I***in***V***in* = **I***out* / **I***in*
Ratio of the p.ds is inverse the ratio of the currents.
![[Excalidraw/ringcoils.md|600]]
Efficiency is affected by:
- Heating effect of a current
- Vibrations (at 50Hz)
- Think about the induced current (e.m.f.) in secondary coil - this has a polarity which opposes the working of the transformer
	**IF** current flows in the iron core, this all gets worse.

#### Summary of lamination:
Making core out of slices stops induced currents from flowing in the core...
Whose polarity would produce magnetism that is opposite to that within the core...
Reducing efficiency...
