### Think:
- What does uniform mean?
- Any ideas how this could be produced?
- What does this imply for electric fields?
- Think about field lines
	Parallel, evenly spaced, (almost always) straight lines
- Think about force
	Same anywhere in field
### Electric Field Between Parallel Plates \[field strength]
- E = V/d
	E = electric field strength / NC$^{-1}$
	V = potential difference \* / V
	d = Distance \* / m
		\* between the plates
For the same p.d and plate separation, E is constant.
F = Eq
