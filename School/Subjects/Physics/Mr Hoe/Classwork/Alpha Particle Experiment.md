###### In experiments carried out to determine the nature of atoms, alpha particles were fired at thin metal foils. Describe how the alpha particle scattering experiments provide evidence for the existence, charge and size of the nucleus. \[5]
When the alpha particles are fired at the thin metal foil, most of them carry on a straight trajectory and pass straight through the foil. Some are deflected by the positive charge of a prot
