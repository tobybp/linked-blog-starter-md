###### In experiments carried out to determine the nature of atoms, alpha particles were fired at thin metal foils. Describe how the alpha particle scattering experiments provide evidence for the existence, charge and size of the nucleus. \[5]
- When the alpha particles are fired at the thin metal foil, most of them carry on a straight trajectory and pass straight through the foil. 
- Many are deflected by the positive charge of a proton within the foil, and their paths are bent away giving a scattering of the alpha particles. 
- Very few, around 1 in every 10,000 alpha particles, are reflected, meaning they switch direction and come back towards their source.
- This means that most of the atoms are made up of empty space, with a small "nucleus" with a positive charge causing deflection and reflection.
###### Describe the nature and range of the three forces acting on the protons and neutrons in the nucleus \[5]
- Electrostatic repulsion - proton-on-proton (charge)
- Strong
- Gravitational

r = r₀ x A$^{1/3}$
p = m / (4/3)πr$^2$
r₀ = 1.2 x 10$^{-15}$
A = number of nucleons
R = radius / m
density = mass/volume
volume = 4/3πr${^3}$
mass = nucleus x average mass for a nucleus = 1.67 x 10$^{-27}$
Calculate the radius of a Lithium-7 nucleus
	7 protons + neutrons
	3 protons
	 = r₀ x 7 
	 = 2.9 x 10$^{-15}$
Calculate the density of a Lithium-7 nucleus
	= m / 4/3π(2.9x10$^{-15}$)$^3$
	= 1.67x10$^{-27}$ /  4/3π((2.9x10$^{-15}$)$^3$)
	= 2.79 x 10$^{17}

Apparently nuclear density is independent of the number of nucleons
4/3πR$^3$
R = r₀A$^{1/3}$
R$^3$ = r₀$^3$A
mass = A x mass of nucleus
density = mass / volume = A\*mass of nucleus / 4/3πr₀$^3$A

F = 1 / 4πε0 is proportional to q1q2 / r₀$^2$ 
F = GMm / r$^2$

- Nucleus contains protons and neutrons
- Anything to concern us about their charge - proton near proton
- Calculate the coulomb repulsion between two protons (Assuming they are r₀ apart)
	F = 160N
	Gravitational force = 1.4 x 10$^{-34}$N
	Way way smaller, therefore must be a third force
Fcharge is much greater than Fgravity
So, we need something else to make it all balance out... Equilibrium of forces...
