###### In experiments carried out to determine the nature of atoms, alpha particles were fired at thin metal foils. Describe how the alpha particle scattering experiments provide evidence for the existence, charge and size of the nucleus. \[5]
- When the alpha particles are fired at the thin metal foil, most of them carry on a straight trajectory and pass straight through the foil. 
- Many are deflected by the positive charge of a proton within the foil, and their paths are bent away giving a scattering of the alpha particles. 
- Very few, around 1 in every 10,000 alpha particles, are reflected, meaning they switch direction and come back towards their source.
- This means that most of the atoms are made up of empty space, with a small "nucleus" with a positive charge causing deflection and reflection.
###### Describe the nature and range of the three forces acting on the protons and neutrons in the nucleus \[5]
- Electrostatic repulsion - proton-on-proton (charge)
	- Infinite range, repulsive between charged particles
	- Large range
- Strong force (p-p, p-n, n-n)
	- 0 - 0.5fm repulsive
	- Short range
- Gravitational force (p-p, p-n, n-n)
	- 0.5 -> 3.0fm attractive
	- Biggest range

c) i) R = r₀A$^{1/3}$
m = 235 x 1.7 x 10$^{-27}$
V = 4/3(πr$^3$) r = 8.8 x 10$^{-15}$
V = 2.8 x 10$^{-42}
p = m/v
Density = 1.4 x 10$^{17}$
ii) One assumption is that it's perfectly spherical and there is no empty space / evenly distributed.
###### Explain how the experiments on the scattering of alpha-particles by a metal foil provided evidence for the nuclear model of the atom.
- In your answer, you should make clear how your conclusions link with the observations.
Nucleus is small, positive and heavy
small - most alpha particles pass through the empty space
positive - alpha particles deflect and are repelled
heavy - head on collision, the alpha particle recoils completely

b) ![[Excalidraw/alphanucleusdiagram.md]]
###### i) The alpha particle comes to rest instantaneously a short distance away from the aluminium nucleus. It then reverses its direction of travel. Describe and explain the motion of the aluminium nucleus at the instant the alpha particle is at rest.
Where has the momentum in alpha particle gone?
Momentum is always conserved
It is in the Al nucleus
Al nucleus recoils right
Al velocity is much less
p = mv if m bigger, v is smaller!
###### ii) Calculate the initial speed of the alpha-particle
mass of alpha-particle = 6.6 x 10^-27 kg
KE = 1/2mv$^2$ = 8.0MeV - **Need J**
4 x 1.66 x 10$^{-27}$
= 1.97 x 10$^7$
###### iii) The electric force experienced by the alpha particle when it is close to the aluminium nucleus is 270N. Calculate the separation r between the alpha particle and the aluminium nucleus when the alpha particle experiences this force.
F = Qq / r$^2$ x 1/ 4π𝜀₀ = 
###### iv) Consider the situation where the alpha particle travels much closer to the aluminium nucleus than in b)iii) Discuss how the strong nuclear force may affect the resultant force on the alpha-particle.
Coulomb force is repulsive (and large), no strong force

r = r₀ x A$^{1/3}$
p = m / (4/3)πr$^2$
r₀ = 1.2 x 10$^{-15}$
A = number of nucleons
R = radius / m
density = mass/volume
volume = 4/3πr${^3}$
mass = nucleus x average mass for a nucleus = 1.67 x 10$^{-27}$
Calculate the radius of a Lithium-7 nucleus
	7 protons + neutrons
	3 protons
	 = r₀ x 7 
	 = 2.9 x 10$^{-15}$
Calculate the density of a Lithium-7 nucleus
	= m / 4/3π(2.9x10$^{-15}$)$^3$
	= 1.67x10$^{-27}$ /  4/3π((2.9x10$^{-15}$)$^3$)
	= 2.79 x 10$^{17}

Apparently nuclear density is independent of the number of nucleons
4/3πR$^3$
R = r₀A$^{1/3}$
R$^3$ = r₀$^3$A
mass = A x mass of nucleus
density = mass / volume = A\*mass of nucleus / 4/3πr₀$^3$A

F = 1 / 4πε0 is proportional to q1q2 / r₀$^2$ 
F = GMm / r$^2$

- Nucleus contains protons and neutrons
- Anything to concern us about their charge - proton near proton
- Calculate the coulomb repulsion between two protons (Assuming they are r₀ apart)
	F = 160N
	Gravitational force = 1.4 x 10$^{-34}$N
	Way way smaller, therefore must be a third force
Fcharge is much greater than Fgravity
So, we need something else to make it all balance out... Equilibrium of forces...
![[Excalidraw/repulseattract.md|600]]
- Shor range
- Attractive when close (<3fm) these distances are quoted in the specification
- Really attractive at the right distance (1.8fm, peak 1.2ish fm)
- Equal to coulomb force at equilibrium 
- Repulsive if nucleons are too close (<0.5fm)
