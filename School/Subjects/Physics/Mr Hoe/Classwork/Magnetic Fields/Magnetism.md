### Flux linkage through a solenoid
#### Φ = NBA
Φ = magnetic flux / Wb
N = number of turns on coil
B = magnetic flux density / T
A = area / m$^2$
#### Φ = BA
B = flux density / area
A = area
Φ = flux for one
### Motor Effect \[recap]
- When a current carrying conductor is in a magnetic field 
- A force acts
- Dependent on the size of the current
- Dependent on the magnetic flux density
- Dependent on the length of conductor in the field
- Direction depending on polarity of current
- Direction depending on polarity of field
#### F - BILsinθ
sinθ = 1 if θ = 90
We want F to be maximum when things are all perpendicular
θ = angle between field lines and conductor.
## Motors
- DC Motor, why does it spin?
