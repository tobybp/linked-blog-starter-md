### Flux linkage through a solenoid
#### Φ = NBA
Φ = magnetic flux / Wb
N = number of turns on coil
B = magnetic flux density / T
A = area / m$^2$
#### Φ = BA
B = flux density / area
A = area
Φ = flux for one
### Motor Effect \[recap]
- When a current carrying conductor is in a magnetic field 
- A force acts
- Dependent on the size of the current
- Dependent on the magnetic flux density
- Dependent on the length of conductor in the field
- Direction depending on polarity of current
- Direction depending on polarity of field
#### F - BILsinθ
sinθ = 1 if θ = 90
We want F to be maximum when things are all perpendicular
θ = angle between field lines and conductor.
## Motors
- DC Motor, why does it spin?
![[DCMotor|700]]
### AC motor, is it different?
- Because a.c. current changes direction in whole circuit, current direction swaps in coil due to a.c.
- Contacts are maintained
- Spins with the same frequency as a.c.
### DC motor, why does it spin?
- We need a current and coil to create an electromagnetic field
- We need the magnets to make a 2nd field so that the coil moves due to the motor effect
- It will move in the direction according to the left hand rule.
- "Current relative to the field"
### Model answer
Current in the coil produces a magnetic field that interacts with the magnetic field around it due to the magnets.
The force has a consistent direction and causes the coil to begin to spin
We have to maintain the direction of the force to maintain the spinning
How?
Direction of current needs to swap in the coil each half turn, to maintain the current direction.
