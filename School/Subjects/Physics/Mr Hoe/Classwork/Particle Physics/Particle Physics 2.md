In 1936, a muon was discovered, roughly 200x mass of electron
Charge = 1.6 x 10$^{-19}$
#### The  beta decay problem
How can an electron be emitted from the nucleus?
Neutron decay?
	n -> p + e$^{-}$
	_Particles can transform?_
	_Mass adds up?_
	_Charge is conserved!_
Parity (Quantum theory)
- good & evil, up & down
- Parity - "Equal and opposite"
- We have neutrons, protons, electrons.
	What do their opposites look like
	
anti-matter:

| Neutron      | Proton      | Electron |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Anti-neutron | Anti-proton | Positron |
| neutral      | e^-         | e^+      |
| mn           | mp          | me       |
### Anti-matter
Has charge and charge is charge...
Has mass and mass is mass...
Substance? - Substantially different?
e$^-$ + e$^+$ -> 2 photons
annihilation!
ΔE = Δmc$^2$
### New words?
- Hadron - Made from quarks, with 3 sub-families
- Baryon = 3 quarks
- Anti-Baryon = 3 anti-quarks
- Meson = quark & anti-quark
- Lepton = made of themselves and fundamental
Fundamental - cannot be broken down
Gluons hold them together
### Quarks

| Name        | Change | Baryon Number | Charm | Strangeness |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| up (u)      | +2/3e  | 1/3           | 0     | 0           |
| down (d)    | -1/3e  | 1/3           | 0     | 0           |
| strange (s) | -1/3e  | 1/3           | 0     | +1          |
| charm (c)   | +2/3e  | 1/3           | -1    | 0           |
| top (t)     |        |               |       |             |
| bottom (b)  |        |               |       |             |
### Rules with quarks/hadrons/particles
Conserved:
- Mass
- Energy
- Charge
- Baryon Number
- Lepton Number
- Strangeness
### Hadrons we know
- Proton: +e, baryon number = 1
	
- Neutron
- Anti-proton
- anti-neutron
