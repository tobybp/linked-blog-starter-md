In 1936, a muon was discovered, roughly 200x mass of electron
Charge = 1.6 x 10$^{-19}$
#### The  beta decay problem
How can an electron be emitted from the nucleus?
Neutron decay?
	n -> p + e$^{-}$
	_Particles can transform?_
	_Mass adds up?_
	_Charge is conserved!_
Parity (Quantum theory)
- good & evil, up & down
- Parity - "Equal and opposite"
- We have neutrons, protons, electrons.
	What do their opposites look like
	
anti-matter:

| Neutron      | Proton      | Electron |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Anti-neutron | Anti-proton | Positron |
| neutral      | e^-         | e^+      |
| mn           | mp          | me       |
### Anti-matter
Has charge and charge is charge...
Has mass and mass is mass...
Substance? - Substantially different?
e$^-$ + e$^+$ -> 2 photons
annihilation!
