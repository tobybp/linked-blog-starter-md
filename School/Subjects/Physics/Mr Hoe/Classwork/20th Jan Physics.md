ΔE = Δmc$^2$
Where
ΔE = change in energy / J
Δm = change in mass* / kg
c = speed of light / ms$^{-1}$
\* mass defect

The unified atomic mass unit
1u = 1.66x10$^{-27}$kg
Where:
u = unified atomic mass unit
u = 1/12 mass of a carbon-12 nucleus
u = a unit in its own right
u = equivalent of 1.66x10$^{-27}$kg
u = John Dalton's idea

Nuclear Binding Energy
The binding energy of a nucleus is the energy released when the nucleus is assembled from its constituent nucleons. This is equal in value to the energy required to separate the nucleus into individual nucleons.
