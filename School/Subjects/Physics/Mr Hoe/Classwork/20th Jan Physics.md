ΔE = Δmc$^2$
Where
ΔE = change in energy / J
Δm = change in mass* / kg
c = speed of light / ms$^{-1}$
\* mass defect

The unified atomic mass unit
1u = 1.66x10$^{-27}$kg
Where:
u = unified atomic mass unit
u = 1/12 mass of a carbon-12 nucleus
u = a unit in its own right
u = equivalent of 1.66x10$^{-27}$kg
u = John Dalton's idea

Nuclear Binding Energy
The **binding energy** of a nucleus is the **energy released** when the nucleus is assembled from its constituent nucleons. This is equal in value to the energy required to separate the nucleus into individual nucleons.
The **binding energy per nucleon** is a **measure of** the **stability** of a nucleus.

- Calculate the mass of 3 protons and 4 neutrons
- This should have the same mass as a Li-7 nucleus, right?
- oh... 
proton mass = 1.007280u
neutron mass = 1.008665u
electron mass = 0.00055u
Li-7 atom mass = 7.01600u
3p + 4n mass
(3 x 1.00728) + (4 x 1.008665) = 7.0565
Li-7 nucleus 7.01600 - (3 x 0.00055) = 7.0145
- Calculate mass loss when Li-7 nucleus forms
	7.0565 - 7.0145 = 0.0420u
- This lost mass is known as the mass defect
- Convert the mass defect into kg
- Plug this into the ΔE = Δmc$^2$
- What does this mean?
