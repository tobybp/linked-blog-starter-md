### Background:
- Charge and mass
- Matter tends to be neutral
- So maybe building blocks are neutral
- Positive and negative
- Cathode ray tubes
	Now called electron emission tubes

- Evenly distributed with mass
- Evenly distributed with charge
- No empty space
- "Gas-like cloud" - plums can stream out from...
## Rutherford's Experiment
![[Excalidraw/rutherfordsexperiment.md|700]]
- Alpha source - radiation
- Gold foil - absorber or deflector
- Detector - notice where alpha particles have travelled
- Vacuum - so alpha particles are not absorbed
### Observations:
- Most of the alpha particles pass straight through (the foil)
- Others are deflected (on the way through the foil)
- About 1/10,000 reflect off the front of the foil
- Front of the foil
### Conclusions:
- Lots of empty space
- Small and positive nucleus causing repulsion for alpha
- Nucleus must be high in mass for alpha particle to rebound (considering momentum)
## The Nuclear Model
![[Excalidraw/NuclearModel.md]]
- Neutral overall
- Lots of empty space
- Small, heavy, positive nucleus
- Very small negative electrons
## Further Discoveries
![[Excalidraw/FurtherDiscoveries.md|700]]
Nucleus is not one big lump, but made of tiny bits.
Alpha particles have knocked proton out from the Al nuclei
## Comparing the models

| Plum                         | Nuclear Model                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Neutral                      | Neutral                            |
| Negative plums               | Electrons                          |
| Positive body                | Positive nucleus                   |
| Charge is evenly distributed | Charge is localised                |
| Mass is evenly distributed   | Mass is localised (in the nucleus) |
| No empty space               | Lots of empty space                |
