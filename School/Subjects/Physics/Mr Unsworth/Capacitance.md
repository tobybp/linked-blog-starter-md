A capacitor is any two conductors separated from each other by an insulating material (or a vacuum)t 
The simplest arrangement is two parallel plates of area A and separation d

When a pd is applied, electrons move from one plate to the other until the pd across the capacitor is equal to e.m.f. source
A capacitor stores charge (separation), and hence energy
