A capacitor is any two conductors separated from each other by an insulating material (or a vacuum)t 
The simplest arrangement is two parallel plates of area A and separation d

When a pd is applied, electrons move from one plate to the other until the pd across the capacitor is equal to e.m.f. source
A capacitor stores charge (separation), and hence energy
Once a capacitor has finished charging, a total charge of Q in electrons has moved from one plate to the other, and there is now a pd V across it.
The capacitance of a capacitor is defined as: "the magnitude of the charge stored on one plate per unit of p.d. between the plates"

C = Q/V
Units:
	\[Q] = coulombs, C
	\[V] = volts, V
	\[c] farads, F
Quick example...
	Calculate the pd across a capacitor of capacitance 0.15 μF when it stores 4.9x10$^{11}$ electrons (e = 1.6 x 10$^{-19}$C)
