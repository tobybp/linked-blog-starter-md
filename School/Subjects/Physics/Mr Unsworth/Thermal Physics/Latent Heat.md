Latent Heat is defined as the energy per unit mass required to change the phase whilst at constant temperature
L = E/m
where L = Latent heat
	E is the energy supplied
	m is the mass of the substance
	Units: Jkg$^{-1}$
- Specific Latent Heat of Fusion, Lf - Defines the latent heat required to change phase between solid and liquid (and vice versa)
	Lf = F/m
- Specific Latent Heat of Vaporisation, Lv - Defines the latent heat required to change phase between liquid and gas (and vice versa)
- The kinetic energy of the molecules remains the same during a phase change
- The potential energy changes
- As a substance is heated - the bonds between molecules become weaker and the electrostatic potential energy increases
