Latent Heat is defined as the energy per unit mass required to change the phase whilst at constant temperature
L = E/m
where L = Latent heat
	E is the energy supplied
	m is the mass of the substance
	Units: Jkg$^{-1}$
- Specific Latent Heat of Fusion, Lf - Defines the latent heat required to change phase between solid and liquid (and vice versa)
	Lf = F/m
- Specific Latent Heat of Vaporisation, Lv
