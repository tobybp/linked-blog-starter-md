Latent Heat is defined as the energy per unit mass required to change the phase whilst at constant temperature
L = E/m
where L = Latent heat
	E is the energy supplied
	m is the mass of the substance
	Units: Jkg$^{-1}$
- Specific Latent Heat of Fusion, Lf - Defines the latent heat required to change phase between solid and liquid (and vice versa)
	Lf = F/m
- Specific Latent Heat of Vaporisation, Lv - Defines the latent heat required to change phase between liquid and gas (and vice versa)
- The kinetic energy of the molecules remains the same during a phase change
- The potential energy changes
- As a substance is heated - the bonds between molecules become weaker and the electrostatic potential energy increases
Is the heater the only thing affecting the melting?
- Use of a control experiment
- Then deduct the mass m(c) from m
- m(melted) = m - m(c)
### Method - you need to know
1) Fill bulb with water
2) Turn heater on
3) **Allow the apparatus to reach constant state.** (ie the rate of boiling equals the rate of condensation - this can be seen by the rate of flow of condensate collected in the flask)
4) Start timer
5) Take readings on the Ammeter, voltmeter, scales and stop clock (every 30 seconds)
6) Plot a graph of E against m
7) Gradient is Lv
8)
