Temperature is a measure of how hot an object is on a chosen scale
AND it relates to the amount of internal energy within a material
AND temperature is a physical property that can be measured
### How do we measure temperature
To be able to measure temperature we need:
- Two reference points
- Something that has a thermal (temperature dependent) property
### Reference points
- Certain processes happen at fixed temperatures e.g. water will freeze / melt and boil at set temperatures. This is used to fix reference points.
## Temperature Scales
Celsius Scale
- Zero point - 0°C - freezing point of pure water
- Upper point - 100°C - boiling point of pure water
- 100 Equal divisions
