Temperature is a measure of how hot an object is on a chosen scale
AND it relates to the amount of internal energy within a material
AND temperature is a physical property that can be measured
### How do we measure temperature
To be able to measure temperature we need:
- Two reference points
- Something that has a thermal (temperature dependent) property
### Reference points
- Certain processes happen at fixed temperatures e.g. water will freeze / melt and boil at set temperatures. This is used to fix reference points.
## Temperature Scales
Celsius Scale
- Zero point - 0°C - freezing point of pure water
- Upper point - 100°C - boiling point of pure water
- 100 Equal divisions
Absolute scale
- Zero point is 0(zero) K called absolute zero
- Upper point is 273.15K the triple point of water
- The size of a 1 Kelvin equal to a 1° Celsius temperature increase
- 0° Celcius is 273.15K
- (simplified to 273 for A level)
T(K) = 0°C + 273
