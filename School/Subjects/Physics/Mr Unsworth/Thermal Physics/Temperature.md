Temperature is a measure of how hot an object is on a chosen scale
AND it relates to the amount of internal energy within a material
AND temperature is a physical property that can be measured
### How do we measure temperature
To be able to measure temperature we need:
- Two reference points
- Something that has a thermal (temperature dependent) property
### Reference points
- Certain processes happen at fixed temperatures e.g. water will freeze / melt and boil at set temperatures. This is used to fix reference points.
## Temperature Scales
Celsius Scale
- Zero point - 0°C - freezing point of pure water
- Upper point - 100°C - boiling point of pure water
- 100 Equal divisions
Absolute scale
- Zero point is 0(zero) K called absolute zero
- Upper point is 273.15K the triple point of water
- The size of a 1 Kelvin equal to a 1° Celsius temperature increase
- 0° Celcius is 273.15K
- (simplified to 273 for A level)
T(K) = 0°C + 273

100°C = 12.5cm
Temperature using homemade thermometer = 15°C
Actual temp = 16°C

## The zeroth law
- Two objects are in thermal equilibrium if thermal energy CAN pass between them, but NO NET thermal energy is actually doing so.
- If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are all in thermal equilibrium with each other.
- You can say that each of these objects has a thermal property that they all share - this property is called temperature. 
## Absolute Zero
- The key discovery leading to absolute zero is that in any system the vibrational energy is proportional to the temperature.
- This means that every system reaches the "no kinetic energy within it point" at the same temperature.
- Absolute zero = no kinetic energy point
- This temperature has been experimentally determined to be -273.15°C
## Solids, Liquids & Gasses
### The kinetic model
- The kinetic model describes the three common phases of matter in the following matter.
### Evaporating and boiling
- Evaporation occurs at all temperatures and is when the most energetic particles escape the liquids surface.
- Boiling only occurs at the boiling point and is where the whole of the liquid is changing state.
## Triple point of water
- The temperature and pressure at which a substance can exist in equilibrium in the liquid, solid, and. gaseous states.
