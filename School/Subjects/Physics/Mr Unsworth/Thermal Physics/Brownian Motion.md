**Random** motion of pollen or smoke particles is due to:
- **Elastic collisions** between particles of smoke and air.
- **Momentum os transferred** from air particles to smoke particles in those collisions
- **Particles caused to move**
## Kinetic Energy Transfer
The mean kinetic energy of smoke particles = mean kinetic energy of air particles.
- Air particles are small mass but high velocity
- Smoke particles high(er) mass but low velocity
## Pressure and Gases
The **kinetic model** describes the process by which pressure is applied by a gas:
1) The particles in a gas move **randomly** throughout their container
2) The container (or an object within the container) is **continually bombarded** by those particles
3) At each collision, a molecule moving with **momentum** (mass x velocity) strikes the surface. The collisions are **elastic**, so the molecule **bounces back with the same velocity in the opposite direction.**
4) This change in velocity **Δv** is equivalent to an **acceleration a**
5) According to Newton's second law, a force **F = ma is exerted** on the **surface of area A** exerting a pressure **P = F/a**
6) The average number of collisions per second controls the average force applied to the object.
7) Hence, pressure applied to an object is the ratio of the average force to the surface area.
