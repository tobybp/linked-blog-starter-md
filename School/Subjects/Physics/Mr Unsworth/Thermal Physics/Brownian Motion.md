**Random** motion of pollen or smoke particles is due to:
- **Elastic collisions** between particles of smoke and air.
- **Momentum os transferred** from air particles to smoke particles in those collisions
- **Particles caused to move**
## Kinetic Energy Transfer
The mean kinetic energy of smoke particles = mean kinetic energy of air particles.
- Air particles are small mass but high velocity
- Smoke particles high(er) mass but low velocity
## Pressure and Gases
The **kinetic model** describes the process by which pressure is applied by a gas:
- The particles in a gas move **randomly** throughout their container
- The container (or an object within the container) is **continually bombarded** by those particles
