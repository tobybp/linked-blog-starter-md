##### Definition:
###### The sum of the random distribution of potential and kinetic energies associated with the molecules in a system.
### Temperature
- Due to kinetic energy increasing with temperature
### Volume
- Due to work being done against the attraction between molecules
- (A bit like the elastic energy stored in stretching elastic)
### Changes in state
- Due to changes in the potential energy within the matter as arrangement of particles is changed.
