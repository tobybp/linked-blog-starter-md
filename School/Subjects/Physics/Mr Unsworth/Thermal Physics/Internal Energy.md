##### Definition:
###### The sum of the random distribution of potential and kinetic energies associated with the molecules in a system.
### Temperature
- Due to kinetic energy increasing with temperature
### Volume
- Due to work being done against the attraction between molecules
- (A bit like the elastic energy stored in stretching elastic)
### Changes in state
- Due to changes in the potential energy within the matter as arrangement of particles is changed.
## What happens during a change of state?
1) As cooling matter reaches the temperature at which it solidifies it continues to release heat energy (assuming surrounding temperature is less than that of the matter)
	**Matter cools and releases energy**
2) This releases thermal energy is converted from potential energy in the particles being lost as they take up the solid arrangement where they are closer together (less stretched elastic)
	**Released thermal energy reduces the potential energy of particles**
