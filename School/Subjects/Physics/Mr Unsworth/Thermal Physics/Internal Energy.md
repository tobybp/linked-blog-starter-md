##### Definition:
###### The sum of the random distribution of potential and kinetic energies associated with the molecules in a system.
### Temperature
- Due to kinetic energy increasing with temperature
### Volume
- Due to work being done against the attraction between molecules
- (A bit like the elastic energy stored in stretching elastic)
### Changes in state
- Due to changes in the potential energy within the matter as arrangement of particles is changed.
## What happens during a change of state?
1) As cooling matter reaches the temperature at which it solidifies it continues to release heat energy (assuming surrounding temperature is less than that of the matter)
	**Matter cools and releases energy**
2) This releases thermal energy is converted from potential energy in the particles being lost as they take up the solid arrangement where they are closer together (less stretched elastic)
	**Released thermal energy reduces the potential energy of particles**
3) The temperature of matter is controlled by the kinetic energy within the matter. So if the temperature does not fall, it must be true that the kinetic energy in the matter has not fallen.
	- **Kinetic energy does not reduce**
	- The **internal energy falls** as a consequence of the **loss of potential energy.**
## Heating a Substance
Changing phase from solid to liquid:
- During **melting**, we are **not changing the temperature**, so **kinetic energy does not increase**, BUT the **potential energy of the molecules does increase**, so the overall **internal energy increases**.
## Specific Heat Capacity
Defined as "the energy required to change the temperature of a 1kg mass of a substance by 1 Kelvin"
Specific Heat Capacity = Energy Transferred / mass x temperature change
