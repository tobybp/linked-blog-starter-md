- Some isotopes have nuclei that are not stable 
- Spontaneous emission of ionising radiation 
	Flow of energy and/or particles
- Spontaneous = without obvious cause 
- Random = without obvious pattern 
- Ionising = causes atoms to become charged 
- Parent nucleus decays to daughter nucleus 
- Activity is the emissions per unit time 
- Sometimes this continues to granddaughter 
- Decay chain
- Radiation is random in nature

## What are the mechanisms for radioactive decay?
Alpha decay = emission of alpha particle (2p+ & 2n)
Beta$^-$ decay = emission of an electron (e$^-$) 
Beta$^+$ decay = emission of a positron (e$^+$) 
Gamma decay = emission of a photon (of energy)
