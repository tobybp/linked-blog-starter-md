Centripetal force is constant resultant force perpendicular to the velocity

We know that ω = θ/t
We also know that θ = s/r or s = rθ
The usual equation for velocity: v = displacement/time = s/t
Instantaneous velocity = v = s/t = rθ/t = rω 
v = rω
Also ω = 2π/T
v = 2πr/T
or v = 2πrf`

#### A DVD rotates 320 times in 2.4s. What is its angular velocity in rad/s? What is the linear velocity of a point 5cm from the center?
	θ = 320rev (2π / 1rev) = 640π rad
	ω = θ/t = 640π / 2.4 = 838 rad/s
	v = rω
	v = 0.05 x 838 = 41.9m/s
#### At what angular speed does the Earth orbit the sun? (Time taken for one revolution = 3.2x10$^7$s)
	ω = 2π/T
	ω = 2π / 3.2x10^7
	ω = 1.96 x 10^-7
	2)
		v = rω = 1.5x10^11 x 2x10^-7 = 30km/s
## Centripetal Acceleration
a = v$^2$/r this proof you do not need to know
Consider an object moving at constant speed v, from
a = rω$^2$
