Centripetal force is constant resultant force perpendicular to the velocity

We know that ω = θ/t
We also know that θ = s/r or s = rθ
The usual equation for velocity: v = displacement/time = s/t
Instantaneous velocity = v = s/t = rθ/t = rω 
v = rω
Also ω = 2π/T
v = 2πr/T
or v = 2πrf`

#### A DVD rotates 320 times in 2.4s. What is its angular velocity in rad/s? What is the linear velocity of a point 5cm from the center?
	θ = 320rev (2π / 1rev) = 640π rad
	ω = θ/t = 640π / 2.4 = 838 rad/s
	v = rω
	v = 0.05 x 838 = 41.9m/s
