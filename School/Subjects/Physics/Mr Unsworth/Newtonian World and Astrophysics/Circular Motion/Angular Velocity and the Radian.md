"The centrifugal force is pushing them outwards causing them to fly off"
**There is no such thing as "centrifugal force".**
There is nothing "pushing" them outwards. Although to the individual it may feel as if there is.
In fact what you are feeling is the increase in centripetal force.
**The reason that the individuals fly off is due to them obeying Newton's first law.**

## Conditions for Circular Motion
When a body travels in a circle, it must constantly change its direction. Its speed may be constant, but its velocity must continually change.
If the velocity changes at a constant rate, then the body must be accelerating with a constant magnitude.
There must therefore be a force acting on the object with a uniform magnitude.
## The Radian - Angular Measurement
**In circular motion calculations the SI unit used is the radian.**
One radian is the angle subtended (angle moved through) by an arc equal to the radius of a circle.
Circumference of a circle = 2πr
**So there are 2π radians in 360º**
![[Excalidraw/RAD.md|700]]
Angle units:
- Revolutions: 1 circle = 1 rev
- Degrees: 1 circle = 360º
- Radians: 1 circle = 2π
**2π = 360º = 1 *rev***
#### Questions:
1) Convert 60º to radians
	60(2π / 360)
	= 1/3π
2) Convert 2 revolutions to radians
	2 x 2π
	= 4π
### Conversion Factors
To convert degrees to radians:
	value of angle x π/180
To convert radians to degrees:
	value of radians x 180/π
## Angular Displacement (θ)
The angular displacement (θ) is the angle that an object in circular motion has turned through.
θ = 1 radian when the angle created when an object travels along an arc of distance s = r
independent of the size of the circle.
	Anticlockwise displacement is +ve
	and a clockwise displacement is -ve.
In terms of radians: θ = s/r
There are 2π radians in a circle equivalent to 360º
## Equations for ω
When a body moves in a circular path of radius r, for a distance s.
The angular velocity (ω) is the reate of change of angular displacement.
Angular velocity:
	ω = dθ/dt = θ/t
If we now consider the case of a complete revolution
	 The object will travel a total of 2π/TΩ
