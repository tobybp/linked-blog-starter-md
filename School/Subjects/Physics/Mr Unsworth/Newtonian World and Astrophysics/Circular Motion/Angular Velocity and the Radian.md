"The centrifugal force is pushing them outwards causing them to fly off"
**There is no such thing as "centrifugal force".**
There is nothing "pushing" them outwards. Although to the individual it may feel as if there is.
In fact what you are feeling is the increase in centripetal force.
**The reason that the individuals fly off is due to them obeying Newton's first law.**

## Conditions for Circular Motion
When a body travels in a circle, it must constantly change its direction. Its speed may be constant, but its velocity must continually change.
If the velocity changes at a constant rate, then the body must be accelerating with a constant magnitude.
There must therefore be a force acting on the object with a uniform magnitude.
## The Radian - Angular Measurement
**In circular motion calculations the SI unit used is the radian.**
One radian is the angle subtended (angle moved through) by an arc equal to the radius of a circle.
Circumference of a circle = 2πr
**So there are 2π radians in 360º**
