## v$^2$ = rgTanθ
### v$^2$ ∝ tanθ

## Worked Example
A conical pendulum consists of a 1.0kg mass on a string, describing a radius of 0.30m
The bob is rotated in a horizontal circle with the string at 30 degrees to the vertical
1) Calculate the tension in the string
2) Calculate the velocity of the bob
3) Calculate the centripetal force
4) Calculate the period of the bob
	Tcosθ = mg
	T = mg / cosθ
	T = (1x9.81)/cos30
	T = 11.3276...N 11.3N 3sf
asdf
	v$^2$ = rgtanθ
	v$^2$ = 0.3 x 9.81 x tan30
	v$^2$ = 1.6991
