a) What is the period of rotation of Earth in seconds? **86400s**
b) What is the angular velocity of Earth? = 7.3 x 10$^{-5}$ rad s$^{-1}$
c) Given that Earth has a radius of 6.4 x 10$^6$m at its equator, what is the linear velocity at Earth's surface? = 467ms$^{-1}$
`Centrifugal force does not exist on its own
`Centrifugal is an "apparent force"
## Equations for Centripetal Force
Using F = ma
by substituting for a by using **a = v$^2$ / r**
we obtain **F = mv$^2$ / r**
now substituting for v using v = rω
we also obtain F = (mr$^2$ω$^2$) / r    =    mrω$^2$
## Centripetal Force and Acceleration
How fast must a roller coaster go through a 25 meter radius vertical loop in order to maintain a constant centripetal acceleration of 1g?
	a = v$^2$/r 
	with a = 9.81ms$^{-2}$ and r = 25m v = √(25m x 9.81ms$^{-2}$) = 15.7ms$^{-1}$

## Practical 
distance = 0.50 x 2 x π = π
20 x distance = 20π
