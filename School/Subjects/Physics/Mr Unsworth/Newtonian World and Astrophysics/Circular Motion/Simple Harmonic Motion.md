## What is an Oscillator?
A motion that repeats itself and has the following characteristics
- **Displacement** (from equilibrium) is greatest at the extremes of the oscillation.
- **Velocity** is greatest at the midpoint.
- **Equilibrium** is at the midpoint of its oscillation; stop the mass at this point and it remains stationary.
- **Inertia** carries it through the midpoint, when the mass is oscillation,
(Inertia - an object's reluctance to change velocity)
#### Simple harmonic motion is a type of oscillation, where the acceleration of the oscillator is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position, and acts towards the equilibrium position
