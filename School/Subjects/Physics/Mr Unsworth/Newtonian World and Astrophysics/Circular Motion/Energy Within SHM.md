- For a spring, Ep = $1/2 kx^2$
- Ep is proportional to $x^2$ meaning that the graph of Eₚ against x is a parabola
- Ep is always positive and varies against x
- When x = 0 (minimum displacement) Eₚ = 0
- When x = A (max displacement) Eₚ = $1/2kA^2$
- BUT also at x = A the glider is stationary, so Ek = 0
- Hence total energy of system = Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2kA^2$
- Eₜₒₜₐₗ = Ep + Ek rearranging gives Ek = Eₜₒₜₐₗ - Ep
- Giving: Ek = $1/2kA^2$ - $1/2kx^2$
- Ek = $1/2k(A^2 - x^2)$
- Ek = $1/2mv^2$
- Ep = 1/2$kx^2$
- Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2mv^2 + 1/2kx^2$ = a constant value
- Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2kA^2$
- $1/2kA^2 = 1/2mv^2 + 1/2kx^2$ 
- v = $√(k/m(A^2 - x^2))$
