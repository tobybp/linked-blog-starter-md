- For a spring, Ep = $1/2 kx^2$
- Ep is proportional to $x^2$ meaning that the graph of Eₚ against x is a parabola
- Ep is always positive and varies against x
- When x = 0 (minimum displacement) Eₚ = 0
- When x = A (max displacement) Eₚ = $1/2kA^2$
- BUT also at x = A the glider is stationary, so Ek = 0
- Hence total energy of system = Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2kA^2$
- Eₜₒₜₐₗ = Ep + Ek rearranging gives Ek = Eₜₒₜₐₗ - Ep
- Giving: Ek = $1/2kA^2$ - $1/2kx^2$
- Ek = $1/2k(A^2 - x^2)$
- Ek = $1/2mv^2$
- Ep = 1/2$kx^2$
- Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2mv^2 + 1/2kx^2$ = a constant value
- Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2kA^2$
- $1/2kA^2 = 1/2mv^2 + 1/2kx^2$ 
- v = $√(k/m(A^2 - x^2))$

## Practice 1
Using the graph below for a particle of mass 400g, determine:
![[Excalidraw/graphbelow.md|700]]
a) The maximum speed of the particle
	KEₘₐₓ  = $/12mv^2$ = $√((2KEmax) / m)$ = $√((2 * 80 * 10^{-3}) / 400 * 10^{-3})$ 0.63ms$^{-1]}$
b) The period of the motion
	Etot = $1/2mω^2 * A^2$ 
	ω = $√((2Etot) / mA^2)$ = $√((2 * 80 * 10))$ ....

2. A mass of 0.25kg is undergoing SHM. Using the graph, determine:
	a) The maximum restoring force
	T = 0.35s, ω = $2π/T$ = 18rads$^{-1}$
	Etot = $1/2mω^2 * A^2$, A = $√((2Etot) / mω^2)$ = $√(2*8 / 0.25*18^2)$ = 0.14m
	Fₘₐₓ  = maₘₐₓ = mAω$^2$ = 0.25 x 0.14 x 18$^2$ = 11N
