- For a spring, Ep = $1/2 kx^2$
- Ep is proportional to $x^2$ meaning that the graph of Eₚ against x is a parabola
- Ep is always positive and varies against x
- When x = 0 (minimum displacement) Eₚ = 0
- When x = A (max displacement) Eₚ = $1/2kA^2$
- BUT also at x = A the glider is stationary, so Ek = 0
- Hence total energy of system = Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2kA^2$
