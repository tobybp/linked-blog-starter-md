- For a spring, Ep = $1/2 kx^2$
- Ep is proportional to $x^2$ meaning that the graph of Eₚ against x is a parabola
- Ep is always positive and varies against x
- When x = 0 (minimum displacement) Eₚ = 0
- When x = A (max displacement) Eₚ = $1/2kA^2$
- BUT also at x = A the glider is stationary, so Ek = 0
- Hence total energy of system = Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2kA^2$
- Eₜₒₜₐₗ = Ep + Ek rearranging gives Ek = Eₜₒₜₐₗ - Ep
- Giving: Ek = $1/2kA^2$ - $1/2kx^2$
- Ek = $1/2k(A^2 - x^2)$
- Ek = $1/2mv^2$
- Ep = 1/2$kx^2$
- Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2mv^2 + 1/2kx^2$ = a constant value
- Eₜₒₜₐₗ = $1/2kA^2$
- $1/2kA^2 = 1/2mv^2 + 1/2kx^2$ 
- v = $√(k/m(A^2 - x^2))$

## Practice 1
Using the graph below for a particle of mass 400g, determine:
![[graphbelow|700]]
a) The maximum speed of the particle
	KEₘₐₓ  = $/12mv^2$ = $√((2KEmax) / m)$ = $√((2 * 80 * 10^{-3}) / 400 * 10^{-3})$ 0.63ms$^{-1]}$
b) The period of the motion
	Etot = $1/2mω^2 * A^2$ 
	ω = $√((2Etot) / mA^2)$ = $√((2 * 80 * 10))$ ....

2. A mass of 0.25kg is undergoing SHM. Using the graph, determine:
	a) The maximum restoring force
	T = 0.35s, ω = $2π/T$ = 18rads$^{-1}$
	Etot = $1/2mω^2 * A^2$, A = $√((2Etot) / mω^2)$ = $√(2*8 / 0.25*18^2)$ = 0.14m
	Fₘₐₓ  = maₘₐₓ = mAω$^2$ = 0.25 x 0.14 x 18$^2$ = 11N

1a) 
	A stabilising mechanism for electrical equipment on board a high-speed train is modelled with 5g mass and two springs.

b)
	i) determine max acceleration of mass during oscillations.
	Ek = $1/2mv^2$ 
	T = 143s
	m = 5 x 10$^{-3}$
	A = 6
	ω$^2$A = $2π / (0.143)$ x 0.006 = 12m/s$^2$
	..
	ii) Calculate max kinetic energy of the mass during the oscillations
	KE = 1/2 x 0.005 x (2π x 0.143 x 0.006)$^2$
	KE = 1.7 x 10$^{-4}$(J)
2) i) The frequency
	Frequency is the same as it is independent of the amplitude
	ii) maximum velocity is reduced because amplitude is reduced
	Max KE is reduced to one quarter 
3) asdf
4) EPE decreases from bottom to top
	GPE increases from bottom to top
	KE starts at zero, finishes at zero and max at equilibrium point
	Air gains thermal energy
