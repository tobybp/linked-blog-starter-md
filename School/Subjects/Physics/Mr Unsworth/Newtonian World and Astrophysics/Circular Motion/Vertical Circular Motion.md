## Mass on String
A body that is in circular motion in the vertical plane also has a centripetal force to cause the change in velocity, but the weight of the body has differing effects depending upon its position.
#### At the top
Consider Newton's Second Law. 
ΣF = ma
Towards the centre is considered positive.

Forces acting are the weight, W = mg 
and Tension in the rope (T)
These two forces provide an acceleration towards the centre (centripetal acceleration)
ma = +W + T
mv$^2$ / r = mg + t 
or T = mv$^2$ / r - mg

#### At the bottom
ma = - W + T
mv$^2$ / r = -mg + T 
or T = mv$^2$ / r + mg

### A Ferris Wheel is Different
Consider the forces acting when sitting on a seat at the top of a Ferris Wheel
ΣF = ma -> ΣF = mv$^2$ / r
-Fn + W = mv$^2$ / r
-Fn + mg = mv$^2$ / r
Fn = mg - mv$^2$ / r

### Pilot sitting in aeroplane
ΣF = ma -> ΣF = mv$^2$ / r
Fn = mv$^2$ / r - mg
