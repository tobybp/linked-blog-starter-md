When f(driving) ≈ f(natural) then the amplitude of the forced oscillation is maximised. This is when the system is said to be in resonance. The system is absorbing energy at the maximum rate from the external oscillator.
## Damping
- Sharpness of peak decreases with increased damping
- Amplitude of oscillations decreases with increased damping
- Increased damping causes the natural frequency of the system to derease (peak shifts left)

## p68/69 Questions
1) a) i) Amplitude is the maximum displacement, displacement is the distance between the stationary point and the current position
	ii) Frequency is the swings per second whilst the angular frequency is the 2π x the frequency
	b) i)
