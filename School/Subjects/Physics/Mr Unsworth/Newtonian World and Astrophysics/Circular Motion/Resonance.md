When f(driving) â‰ˆ f(natural) then the amplitude of the forced oscillation is maximised. This is when the system is said to be in resonance. The system is absorbing energy at the maximum rate from the external oscillator.
## Damping
- Sharpness of peak decreases with increased damping
- Amplitude of oscillations decreases with increased damping
- Increased damping causes the natural frequency of the system to derease (peak shifts left)
