- In principle, an oscillation should last forever
- In practice, resistive forces mean the total enrgy of the system decreases with time, causing the amplitude to decrease exponentially. This is **damping**
- The effect of this is that the amplitude decreases exponentially over time (since normally Fdrag ‚àù v)
- (Note that the period does NOT change though - as SHM oscillations are known as isochronous)
