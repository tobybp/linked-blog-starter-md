g = F/m (definition for gravitational field strength)
F = -GMm/r$^2$  Newton's law of gravitation
Combining these gives g = (-GMm / r$^2$) / m
g = -GM / r$^2$

## Kepler's Laws
Law 1:
- All the planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one of the two foci of the ellipse
Law 2:
- A line drawn from one sun to the planet will sweep out equal areas in equal times as the planet moves in its orbit.
Law 3:
- The square of the period of the orbit, T, is proportional to the cube of the mean distance from the sun r T$^2$ proportional to r$^3$
