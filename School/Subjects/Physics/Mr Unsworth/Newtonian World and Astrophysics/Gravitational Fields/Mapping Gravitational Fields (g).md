g = F/m (definition for gravitational field strength)
F = -GMm/r$^2$  Newton's law of gravitation
Combining these gives g = (-GMm / r$^2$) / m
g = -GM / r$^2$

## Kepler's Laws
#### Law 1:
- All the planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one of the two foci of the ellipse
#### Law 2:
- A line drawn from one sun to the planet will sweep out equal areas in equal times as the planet moves in its orbit.
#### Law 3:
- The square of the period of the orbit, T, is proportional to the cube of the mean distance from the sun r T$^2$ proportional to r$^3$
## Proving Kepler's 3rd Law:
Centripetal force on planet = gravitational force on planet: F = mv$^2$/r = GMm/r$^2$
v$^2$ = GM/r
as v = 2πr / T, (2πr)$^2$ / T$^2$ = GM/r
r$^3$ / T$^2$ = GM/4πr$^2$
T$^2$ = 4π$^2$r$^3$ / MG
Everything else is constant, so T$^2$ is proportional to r$^3$ 
## Kepler's Laws Beyond Planets
Kepler's laws apply to any small object in orbit around a larger one, including satellites and moons in orbits around planets.
