- All bodies with mass create a gravitational field
- This field extends to infinity getting weaker as the distance increases
- Any body placed within the gravitation field of another will experience an attractive force **towards the centre of mass** of the other.
- The force due to gravity is **ALWAYS** an attractive one
- We can represent these forces with field lines
- Bodies will move along these resultant field lines.
- **A gravitational field is a region around a body which another body with mass will experience a force.**
- **The strength of a gravitational field, g, is the force per unit mass on a small test mass placed in the field.**
- g = F/m (F is the force acting on the small mass, m)
