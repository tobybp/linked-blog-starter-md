- All bodies with mass create a gravitational field
- This field extends to infinity getting weaker as the distance increases
- Any body placed within the gravitation field of another will experience an attractive force **towards the centre of mass** of the other.
- The force due to gravity is **ALWAYS** an attractive one
- We can represent these forces with field lines
- Bodies will move along these resultant field lines.
- **A gravitational field is a region around a body which another body with mass will experience a force.**
- **The strength of a gravitational field, g, is the force per unit mass on a small test mass placed in the field.**
- g = F/m (F is the force acting on the small mass, m)
## Free Fall and Newton's Second Law
g is also described as the acceleration due to a freely falling body
Prove that Nkg$^{-1}$ is the same as ms$^{-2}$
Nkg$^{-1}$ is force / kg
F = ma = kgm$^{-2}$
Nkg$^{-1}$ is (kgms$^{-2}$)/kg
= ms$^{-2}$
## Gravitational Field Patterns
Uniform field - is where the gravitational field strength is the same in **magnitude and direction** throughout the field, and the lines must be **parallel** to each other.
Radial Field - is where the gravitational field strength is varied radially from the centre of the body as distance changes. Further from the centre of the body, the **field strength decreases shown by the field lines getting further apart**
## Point Masses
You can model a spherical mass as a point mass
Always use the centre NOT surface to surface
## Newton's Law of Gravitation
**The size of the gravitational force between two bodies is described by Newton's Law of gravitation.**
Fg = -(GMm / r$^2$)

Fg = -(6.67 x 10$^{-11}$ x 20 x 67) / 0.5$^2$
