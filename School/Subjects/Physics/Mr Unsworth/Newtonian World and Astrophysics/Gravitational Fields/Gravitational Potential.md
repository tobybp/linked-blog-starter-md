Vg = - GM/r
Since work done depends only on the displacement in the direction of the force (i.e. radially) the change in GPE between A and B is independent of ...
If we define GPE = 0 at infinity
GPE = mgh
GPE = m(-GM)/r$^2$)r = -GMm/r (=m∆Vg)
### General Rule
If masses are getting closer together, ∆GPE < 0
If masses are getting further apart, ∆GPE > 0

If an object is given enough kinetic energy it can escape the gravitational field of the larger mass. The mini
