Vg = - GM/r
Since work done depends only on the displacement in the direction of the force (i.e. radially) the change in GPE between A and B is independent of ...
If we define GPE = 0 at infinity
GPE = mgh
GPE = m(-GM)/r$^2$)r = -GMm/r (=m∆Vg)
### General Rule
If masses are getting closer together, ∆GPE < 0
If masses are getting further apart, ∆GPE > 0

If an object is given enough kinetic energy it can escape the gravitational field of the larger mass. The minimum speed to do this is called the escape velocity, Vesc, for which
KE = GPE
1/2mv$^2$ = GMm/r
v = √(2GM/r)
