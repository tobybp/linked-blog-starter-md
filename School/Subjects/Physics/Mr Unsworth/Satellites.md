We can deduce an equation for the orbital speed of an object orbiting a larger mass.
F = GMm / r$^2$ = mv$^2$ / r
v$^2$ = GM / r
v = √(GM / r)

## Low Earth Orbits
- Are close to the earth
- Have orbital periods around 90 minutes so can capture multiple images per day
- Can capture hi-res images
- Require little energy to put into orbit.
t## Polar Orbits
- Ear
