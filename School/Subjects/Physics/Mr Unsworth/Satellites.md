We can deduce an equation for the orbital speed of an object orbiting a larger mass.
F = GMm / r$^2$ = mv$^2$ / r
v$^2$ = GM / r
v = √(GM / r)

## Low Earth Orbits
- Are close to the earth
- Have orbital periods around 90 minutes so can capture multiple images per day
- Can capture hi-res images
- Require little energy to put into orbit.
## Polar Orbits
- Earth mapping
- Environmental monitoring
- Military reconnaissance
- Weather forecasting
## Geostationary Orbits
- Have a period of 24 hours, in the same direction as Earth's rotation
- Are in orbit above the equator
- Remain above the same fixed point in the sky relative to an observer on the Earth
- Used for communication and weather monitoring
	- 3 satellites can give complete coverage for the whole of the earth's surface.
