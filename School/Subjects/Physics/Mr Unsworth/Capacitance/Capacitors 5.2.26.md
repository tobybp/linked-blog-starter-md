C = (A/d)ε
A = (field facing) area of one plate
d = separation of plates
ε = permittivity of medium between plates = 8.85 x 10$^{-12}$Fm$^{-1}$

A **fully charged capacitor** can be thought of as a **power supply**. When the **switch** is **closed**, the **charge** will **flow** from one plate to the other, **dissipating** its **energy** through the **resistor**.
As charge leaves, the **pd** across the capacitor **decreases**.
Q = Q$_0$e$^{-t/RC}$ 
	Exponential decay
## Time Constant
If the initial charge, pd and current are Q$_0$, V$_0$, and I$_0$ respectively:
Q = Q$_0$e$^{-t/RC}$ 
I = I$_0$e$^{-t/RC}$ 
If t = RC, then V, Q and I all frop to e$^{-1}$ times their initial value (roughly 37%)
V = V$_0$e$^{-t/RC}$ = V$_0$e$^{-RC/RC}$ = V$_0$e$^{-1}$ = 0.37V$_0$
The time constant, τ = RC (unit: seconds), is the time taken for the V, Q or I to drop to e$^{-1}$ (roughly 37%) of the original value when discharging
The **larger** the **value** of τ, the **longer** the **time** taken for a given capacitor to **discharge**
lnQ = ln(Q$_0$e$^{-1/RC}$)
lnQ = lnQ$_0$ - 1/RC x t
Gradient = -1/RC
Y intercept = lnQ$_0$
