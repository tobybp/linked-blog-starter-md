C = (A/d)ε
A = (field facing) area of one plate
d = separation of plates
ε = permittivity of medium between plates = 8.85 x 10$^{-12}$Fm$^{-1}$

A **fully charged capacitor** can be thought of as a **power supply**. When the **switch** is **closed**, the **charge** will **flow** from one plate to the other, **dissipating** its **energy** through the **resistor**.
As charge leaves, the **pd** across the capacitor **decreases**.
Q = Q$_0$e$^{t/RC}$
