Unlike batteries, capacitors release stored energy very quickly and generate high power output. They can be used to provide back-up power for computers and emergency lighting when the mains supply cuts out briefly.
Capacitors are often used in things like computer motherboards to "smooth" AC input voltages.
The "ripple" in output voltage can be kept small by making the time constant much greater than the period of the AC voltage.
