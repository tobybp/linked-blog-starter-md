F = kx
ma = kx
a = -k/m \* x
ω = √(k/m)
## Method 1
- Attach a mass of a known weight to the end of your string.
- Attach a metre rule behind or next to the spring to measure the initial and final length of the string
- The change in distance is the extension.
- 
- Use F = ke to work out the spring constant (k) of your spring.
