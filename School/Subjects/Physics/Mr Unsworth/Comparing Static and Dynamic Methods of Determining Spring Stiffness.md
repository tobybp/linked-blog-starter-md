F = kx
ma = kx
a = -k/m \* x
ω = √(k/m)
## Method 1
- Wear safety goggles to be safe
- Attach a mass of a known weight to the end of your string.
- Attach a metre rule behind or next to the spring to measure the initial and final length of the string
- Let the mass settle with it's new weight.
- The change in distance is the extension.
- Repeat for different masses
- Use F = ke to work out the spring constant (k) of your spring.
- Plot a graph of F against e, and use F = ke to calculate the spring constant
## Method 2
- Measure the mass using a balance or a known mass.
- Work out force with a newton metre / datalogger
- Measure the time period for 10 oscillations and divide this time by 10.
- Plot a graph of T$^2$ against m and calculate the gradient, to find T$^2$ = 4π$^2$ / r
