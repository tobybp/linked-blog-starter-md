- 1 mol of any substance is the amount of that substance that contain sas many elementary particles as there are atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.
- This number is called the Avogadro constant Nₐ
- ... handout. ...

N = n x Nₐ
Worked example:
	If I have 3 mols of a material, find the number of particles.
## How Gas Causes Pressure
Equation for momentum:
	Momentum = mass x velocity
Now consider a particle travelling towards the wall of a container.
Its change in momentum = Final momentum - initial momentum
= (-mu) - (mu)
Therefore, change in momentum = -2mu
