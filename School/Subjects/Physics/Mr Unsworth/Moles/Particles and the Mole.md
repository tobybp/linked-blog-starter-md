- 1 mol of any substance is the amount of that substance that contain sas many elementary particles as there are atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.
- This number is called the Avogadro constant Nₐ
- ... handout. ...

N = n x Nₐ
Worked example:
	If I have 3 mols of a material, find the number of particles.
## How Gas Causes Pressure
Equation for momentum:
	Momentum = mass x velocity
Now consider a particle travelling towards the wall of a container.
Its change in momentum = Final momentum - initial momentum
= (-mu) - (mu)
Therefore, change in momentum = -2mu
Force = Δp / Δt
Δt is the time taken between collisions on the wall of the cube.
speed = distance / time
Therefore time = distance / speed = 2L / u
Force = Δp / Δt
Force = -2mu / 2L / u
Force = -2mu x u/2L = -mu$^2$ / L
Using Newton's third law, the force on Face A of the box will be equal and opposite
Force on the wall = mu$^2$ / L
Pressure = Force / Area
Area = L$^2$
Pressure = mu$^2$ / L / L$^2$
Pressure = mu$^2$ / L$^3$ where L$^3$ is the volume of the box
Pressure = mu$^2$ / V
Hence pressure is inversely proportional to the volume
When a particle collides elastically with a container wall, it bounces off with the same speed but now has a different direction, so there is a change in velocity and hence momentum.
Since F = dp/dt this means the wall exerted a force on the molecule.
By Newton's 3rd law, the molecule exerts an equal and opposite force on the wall
The sum of all these forces over the area of the container walls is equal to the pressure
