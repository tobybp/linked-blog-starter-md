[[School Council]]
#1/10/25 
- More bag racks near Goodfield – too few/small in DT, nowhere to put bag for Computing/Art get very full. 3rd Yr  use Gym. Not ideally located for form-time. More as it’s a high traffic area
	
- As form tutors to re-emphasise which bag racks to use – Mr Jones
	
- New College Boys loos – taps way too hot 
	
- Girls Art Block Mirrors – no mirrors currently, are there plans to add some?
	
- More Yondr (phone magnets) unlockers outside New College entrance?
	
- Water dispensers – v. slow, not working v. well, leaky across the school site.
	
- Thinking of adding a 'maintenance button' sort of like the confide button.
