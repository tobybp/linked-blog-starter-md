## Personal Statement
### Before
#### Section 1:
I have enjoyed studying computer science at GCSE and A Level. I am looking forward to specialising into cyber security as that is an area that particularly interests me. The rapidly changing environment and dynamics in the field are captivating and interesting. I became increasingly interested in cyber security during the development of my computer science NEA. Whilst developing a construction progress tracker I was intrigued as to how I could make the system impenetrable to threat actors. This experience helped me to realise my interest in cyber security.
#### Section 2:
A-Level Maths and Computer Science have provided a foundation of skills and knowledge for starting university-level Computer Science. I have participated in the Bebras computational thinking competitions three times, achieving two distinctions, and a Merit, as well as two gold awards for finishing in the top 10%. I got into the Oxford University Computing Challenge and received a merit. I have also taken part in the Senior Mathematical Challenge 2024, and achieved a Bronze Certificate. My Computer Science NEA has provided experience dealing with SQL Databases and object oriented programming in high level languages.
#### Section 3:
My wide range of experiences outside of the classroom have prepared me for success in computing. I have been a Cubs leader for 3 years, and have attained the Gold Chief Scout Award. This volunteering and participation has helped advance my teamwork and leadership skills, and shows long-term commitment. I can code in Python, C# and SQL, shown through attending Code Quest in 2023, 2024, and 2025. I have achieved grade 8 on the saxophone and grade 7 on piano, this shows my dedication to mastering complex skills. I am doing my Gold DofE, highlighting determination and teamwork skills.

### After
#### Section 1:
I have always appreciates the logical nature of computer science, and have enjoyed the challenge of problem solving. Whilst studying GCSE computer science, I was recommended the podcast "Darknet Diaries" and I was fascinated with the case involved in "Pizza Problem". I listened to more and more whenever I could, relishing the details and specifics of the cyber crime cases, enjoying the sense of technical challenge and accomplishment in thwarting security breaches. I am inspired by the rapidly evolving and changing environment and dynamics of the field and it excites me that the subject are will be continuously evolving and expanding, throughout my time on the course and in my career beyond. As well as the immediate relevance and appeal of cyber security, I relish the breadth of possibilities that a well designed algorithm can achieve. I am in awe of PageRank, the Google search algorithm, identifying millions of relevant results in fractions of a second! Currently I enjoy the diversity of all aspects of computer science, but I hope that reaching higher levels of understanding and competence will lead me to select a field to specialise in.
#### Section 2:
My problem solving skills are challenged in my NEA, solving an issue with an inefficient software system that uses multiple programs to record progress data on a civil engineering project. I have used SQL with databases and object oriented programming in high level languages to optimise the workflow and am pleased to be able to apply my skills to improve the efficiency of a system used in a professional environment in the construction industry. My communication skills have improved along with my confidence working alongside a corporate industry. I have shown my determination to succeed and felt the reward of patience and logical thinking when faced with complex problem solving. Three years of involvement in the Code Quest competition has developed my ability to work under pressure and perform as part of a team. I learned to divide tasks and share goals, communicating and collaborating effectively to find solutions to complex coding questions using Python and C#. I worked effectively within time constraints and loved the feeling of team success as we relished the challenge of competing with the best computer brains in the country. My independence and self confidence grew, as I participated individually on the Bebras computational thinking competitions, where I achieved two distinctions and a merit, with two gold awards for the top 10%, qualifying me for the Oxford University Computing Challenge. Here I learned the importance of precision and accuracy under time constraint while coping with competitive pressure. I look forward to constantly adding to my technical knowledge, whilst working with like-minded people to overcome increasingly challenging scenarios.
